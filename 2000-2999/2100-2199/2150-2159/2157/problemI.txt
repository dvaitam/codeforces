You and Bob are fighting a single boss with **health = n**.

You and Bob take turns; **you go first**.

On each turn, a player may choose an integer **x** in ([1, m]) and deal **x damage**, replacing:

[
n \leftarrow n - x
]

**Restriction:**
A player **cannot** use the same value of **x** that the opponent used **on the previous turn**.
(But on the **very first move**, you may choose any (x \in [1,m]).)

The first player to make the boss’s health **≤ 0** wins the game.

Your task:
Determine **whether you can force a win** assuming Bob plays optimally.

---

# **Input**

The input contains **multiple test cases**.

* First line: integer (t), number of test cases
  [
  1 \le t \le 10^4
  ]

Each test case consists of:

* Two integers (n, m)
  [
  1 \le n \le 10^6,\quad 2 \le m \le 10^6
  ]

There are **no constraints** on the sum of all (n) or all (m).

---

# **Output**

For each test case, print:

* **YES** — if you can force a win
* **NO** — otherwise

(case-insensitive)

# **Explanation (from PDF)**

### Test 1: `6 9`

You can deal **8 damage** immediately, making health (6 - 8 = -2).
You win → **YES**

---

### Test 2: `20 10`

* You can deal **10** first.
* Bob must deal something in ([1,10]\setminus{10}).
* Then you can again deal **10** and win.

So → **YES**

---

### Test 3: `69 2`

Possible move patterns are forced:

* If you play 1 → Bob must play 2 → you must play 1 → Bob plays 2 → ...

Or reversed:

* If you play 2 → Bob must play 1 → you play 2 → Bob plays 1 → ...

Bob always delivers the final blow.
So → **NO**
