**Time limit:** 2 seconds
**Memory limit:** 256 megabytes

There are (10^9) players in the world championship of the **Billion Players Game**.
You want to predict the final ranking of **Godflex**, your favorite streamer.

You are certain that Godflex will finish with a final rank:

[
l \le p \le r
]

—but you do not know anything else about the exact value of (p).

There are **n offers** made by the in-game bookmaker.

In the (i)-th offer, the bookmaker gives an estimated final ranking (a_i) for Godflex.

For each offer, you must choose **exactly one** of these three actions:

1. **Ignore** the offer.
2. **Accept** the offer claiming that
   [
   p \le a_i
   ]
   If correct, you **earn** (|,p - a_i,|) robocoins;
   if wrong, you **lose** (|,p - a_i,|) robocoins.
3. **Accept** the offer claiming that
   [
   p \ge a_i
   ]
   If correct, you **earn** (|,p - a_i,|);
   if wrong, you **lose** (|,p - a_i,|).

After you select an action for all offers, the actual game is played.
Godflex ends up with some rank (p \in [l, r]).
All accepted offers are then settled.

Your **total score** is the number of robocoins you are **guaranteed** to earn —
that is, the **minimum** outcome over all possible (p \in [l, r]).

You must compute the **maximum** possible guaranteed score.

# **Input**

The first line has an integer
[
t \quad (1 \le t \le 10^4)
]

Each test case contains:

* A line with integers
  [
  n,\ l,\ r \quad (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5,\ 1 \le l \le r \le 10^9)
  ]
* A line with
  [
  a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \quad (1 \le a_i \le 10^9)
  ]

The total sum of all (n) across test cases ≤ (2 \cdot 10^5).

---

# **Output**

For each test case, print **one integer** —
the maximum guaranteed number of robocoins you can secure.

# **Example**

**Input**

```
4
1 1 5
3
2 100 100
50 200
5 1 10
5 7 3 9 1
5 6 10
9 3 1 7 5
```

**Output**

```
0
150
12
13
```

# **Explanation (from PDF)**

### Test case 1

* Ignore → guaranteed 0
* Claim (p \le 3) → worst case at (p=5): lose (|5-3|=2)
* Claim (p \ge 3) → worst case at (p=1): lose (|1-3|=2)

Max guaranteed = **0**

### Test case 2

Claim

* (p \ge 50)
* (p \le 200)

Since actual (p) must be 100:

You gain (|100 - 50| + |100 - 200| = 150).
