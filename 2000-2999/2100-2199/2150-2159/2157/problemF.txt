You are an adventurer working for the futuristic corporation **RoboCorp**.

Your current skill level is an integer **s** in the range:

[
1 \le s \le n
]

—but you **don’t know its exact value**.

Your goal is to reach **skill ≥ n** by completing missions.
Each mission costs robocoins.

You can choose missions of **any difficulty y** (positive integer) and **any positive duration l** (hours).

The cost of a mission depends on:

* the new mission’s **duration l**
* the relation between the new mission’s **difficulty y** and your **most recent mission’s difficulty x**

Let **x** be the difficulty of your most recent mission.

If you want to undertake a new mission with **difficulty y** and **duration l**:

* If it is your **first mission**, or if **y ≤ x**,
  **cost = l**

* If **y > x**,
  **cost = l + 1000**

Your skill improves only when you do a mission whose difficulty **exactly equals** your **current unknown skill**.

* If **y = s**, then your new skill becomes **s += l**
* Otherwise, the skill does not change

After each mission, you *still don’t know your skill*.

You start with a budget of **10⁶ robocoins**.

Your task is to produce **any sequence of missions** that **never exceeds this budget**, and **guarantees** that your final skill is **at least n**, regardless of the initial skill.

# **Input**

A single integer **n** (either `4` or `250000`):
the required final skill level.

There are **2 tests** in this problem (including the example).

* Example input is **n = 4**
* The real system test uses **n = 250000**

Hacks are disabled.

# **Output**

* First line: integer **k** — number of missions you will take.
* Next **k** lines: two integers per line
  **y, l** — the mission’s difficulty and duration
  with
  [
  1 \le y, l \le 10^6
  ]

These missions must guarantee that your final skill ≥ n for *any* starting skill in `[1, n]`.

# **Example**

**Input**

```
4
```

**Output**

```
4
1 4
3 1
2 1
3 1
```

# **Explanation (from PDF)**

For the target skill **n = 4**, a valid strategy:

1. Mission difficulty **1**, duration **4**
   Cost = 4

2. Mission difficulty **3**, duration **1**
   Previous was 1, so 3 > 1 → Cost = 1 + 1000 = 1001

3. Mission difficulty **2**, duration **1**
   Previous was 3, so 2 ≤ 3 → Cost = 1

4. Mission difficulty **3**, duration **1**
   Previous was 2 → 3 > 2 → Cost = 1 + 1000 = 1001

Total cost = 2007 ≤ 10⁶ (budget ok)

This strategy guarantees skill ≥ 4 for any initial skill 1–4.
