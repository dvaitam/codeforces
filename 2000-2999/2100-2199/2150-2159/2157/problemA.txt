An array is called **balanced** if every integer **x** that occurs at least once occurs **exactly x times** in the array.

For example:

* `[1, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 2]` is balanced
* `[2]` and `[2, 2, 2]` are not balanced.

You are given an array **a** of **n** elements:
`[a₁, a₂, …, aₙ]`

The array may not be balanced. You are allowed to **delete** some elements.
Your task is to find the **minimum number of elements** you need to delete so that the array becomes balanced.

# **Input**

Each test contains multiple test cases.

* The first line contains **t** — the number of test cases
  (1 ≤ t ≤ 500)

Each test case consists of:

* A line containing integer **n** (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — size of the array
* A line containing **n** integers
  `a₁, a₂, …, aₙ`
  where 0 ≤ aᵢ ≤ n

There are **no constraints** on the sum of n across test cases.

# **Output**

For each test case, print a single integer:
the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array balanced.

# **Example**

**Input**

```
4
3
1 2 2
5
1 1 2 2 3
10
1 2 3 2 4 4 4 4 5 2
1
0
```

**Output**

```
0
2
3
1
```

**Explanation**

* Test 1: `[1, 2, 2]` is already balanced → answer = 0
* Test 2: Remove one `1` and one `3`, resulting in `[1, 2, 2]` → balanced
* Others follow similarly.
