F. Triple Attacktime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard output Zeus is analyzing a replay of the fight to understand his opponent's attack patterns. The opponent has a special ability: if they land three attacks on a target within a time frame of $$$z$$$, their third attack becomes a powerful, boosted attack.To outplay his opponent, Zeus should not let his opponent trigger their boosted attack. Let $$$Y = \{y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_m\}$$$ be the multiset of $$$m$$$ timestamps, where each $$$y_i$$$ represents the time when the opponent's attack landed. We call $$$Y$$$ to be safe if for every three timestamps $$$\{y_i, y_j, y_k\}$$$ such that $$$1 \le i < j < k \le m$$$, it holds that $$$\max(y_i, y_j, y_k) - \min(y_i, y_j, y_k) > z$$$, where $$$z$$$ is the duration of the time frame that is given to you as an input.Zeus has a log of $$$n$$$ timestamps, $$$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$$$, representing when the opponent's attacks landed. The timestamps are sorted in nondecreasing order of occurrence. In other words, $$$x_i \le x_{i+1}$$$ for all $$$1 \le i < n$$$. Zeus has $$$q$$$ intervals of interest, denoted as two integers $$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$. For each interval, Zeus wants to find the maximum number of attacks among $$$[x_l, x_{l+1}, \ldots, x_r]$$$ that he could have let through: In other words, Zeus wants to find a maximum size subset of the multiset $$$\{x_l, x_{l+1}, \ldots, x_r\}$$$ such that the subset is safe.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 20\,000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$z$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 250\,000$$$, $$$1 \le z \le 10^9$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$$$ ($$$1 \le x_i \le 10^9$$$) — the timestamps of the opponent's attacks. It is guaranteed that the array $$$x$$$ is sorted, i.e., $$$x_i \le x_{i+1}$$$ for all $$$1 \le i < n$$$.The third line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 250\,000$$$).The next $$$q$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$) — the endpoints of the interval.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$250\,000$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$250\,000$$$. OutputFor each of the $$$q$$$ queries, print a single integer — the maximum size of a safe subset of attack timestamps in the given interval.ExampleInput36 101 5 7 8 11 1261 61 52 61 42 53 66 11 1 1 3 3 323 31 612 154 5 15 24 27 32 36 39 40 46 48 48201 121 116 101 88 1211 122 93 87 87 104 89 129 102 121 53 124 83 77 1210 11Output3222221466242253222226452322NoteIn the first query of the first test case, we consider the timestamps $$$\{1, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12\}$$$ with $$$z=10$$$. The subset $$$\{1, 5, 12\}$$$ is safe because its only triplet satisfies $$$12 - 1 = 11 > 10$$$. It's impossible to form a safe subset of size $$$4$$$, hence the answer to this query is $$$3$$$.In the first query of the second test case, we consider the timestamps $$$\{1\}$$$ with $$$z=1$$$. The entire set $$$\{1\}$$$ is safe because there are no triplets. Hence the answer to this query is $$$1$$$.In the second query of the second test case, we consider the timestamps $$$\{1,1,1,3,3,3\}$$$ with $$$z=1$$$.The subset $$$S = \{1,1,3,3\}$$$ is safe because:   For the triple $$$(i,j,k) = (1,2,3)$$$, $$$\max(1,1,3) - \min(1,1,3) = 2 > 1$$$.  For the triple $$$(i,j,k) = (1,2,4)$$$, $$$\max(1,1,3) - \min(1,1,3) = 2 > 1$$$.  For the triple $$$(i,j,k) = (1,3,4)$$$, $$$\max(1,3,3) - \min(1,3,3) = 2 > 1$$$.  For the triple $$$(i,j,k) = (2,3,4)$$$, $$$\max(1,3,3) - \min(1,3,3) = 2 > 1$$$. It's impossible to form a safe subset of size $$$5$$$, hence the answer to this query is $$$4$$$.
