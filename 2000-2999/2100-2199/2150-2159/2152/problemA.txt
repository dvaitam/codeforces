His goal is to transform it into a given target array using a minimum number of operations.He can perform the following two types of operations any number of times, in any order:  Increase: Choose any positive integer $$$x$$$. Increase all elements of the array $$$a$$$ by $$$x$$$. In other words, he chooses a positive integer $$$x$$$, and for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$), he replaces $$$a_i$$$ with $$$a_i + x$$$.  Smash: Set some elements (possibly none or all) of the array $$$a$$$ to $$$0$$$. In other words, for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$), he either replaces $$$a_i$$$ with $$$0$$$ or leaves it as before. Given the final target state of the array $$$a$$$, find the minimum total number of operations (both Increase and Smash) Geumjae needs to perform.It can be shown that for any given final array, a sequence of operations always exists.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 100$$$) — the elements of the target array $$$a$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations required.ExampleInput331 1 3110099 9 3 2 4 4 8 5 3Output3111NoteExplanation of the first test case:The target array is $$$[1, 1, 3]$$$. A possible sequence of 3 operations (which is the minimum) is:  Initially, the array is $$$[0, 0, 0]$$$. After an Increase operation with $$$x = 2$$$, the array becomes $$$[2, 2, 2]$$$.  Next, after a Smash operation on the first two elements, the array becomes $$$[0, 0, 2]$$$.  Finally, after an Increase operation with $$$x = 1$$$, the array becomes $$$[1, 1, 3]$$$. We used $$$2$$$ Increase operations and $$$1$$$ Smash operation for a total of $$$3$$$ operations.Explanation of the second test case:The target array is $$$[100]$$$. A single Increase operation with $$$x = 100$$$ gives the target array.
