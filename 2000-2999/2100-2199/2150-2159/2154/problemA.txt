A. Notelocktime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTeto is playing the hit rhythm game osu!. The game can be described by a binary string$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and a positive integer $$$k$$$ where the following will happen in order:  You will choose some positions in $$$s$$$ to protect.  Then for each $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$) in increasing order, Teto can set $$$s_i$$$ to $$$\mathtt{0}$$$ if all the following are true:   $$$s_i = \mathtt{1}$$$,  $$$s_i$$$ is not protected,  the previous $$$k - 1$$$ elements do not contain $$$\mathtt{1}$$$. More formally, $$$\mathtt{1}$$$ does not occur in $$$s_{\max(1, i - k + 1)},\ldots,s_{i - 1}$$$.  You dislike Teto (for some reason). So determine the minimum number of positions you need to protect to force her to leave $$$s$$$ unchanged.$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A binary string is a string that only consists of characters $$$\mathtt{0}$$$ and $$$\mathtt{1}$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each testcase contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 1000$$$; $$$2 \le k \le n$$$) — the length of $$$s$$$ and $$$k$$$.The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of characters $$$\mathtt{0}$$$ and $$$\mathtt{1}$$$.The sum of $$$n$$$ across all testcases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.OutputFor each testcase, output the minimum number of positions you need to protect to force Teto to leave the string unchanged.ExampleInput92 2116 61000015 3100007 210101017 400000013 30103 20117 410010018 300000000Output111411110NoteFor the first testcase, you can protect the first element and have: $$$s = \mathtt{\color{red}{1}1}$$$. Now Teto cannot change $$$s_1$$$ because it is protected and cannot change $$$s_2$$$ because $$$s_1 = \mathtt{1}$$$. It can be proven this is optimal.For the second testcase, you can protect only the first element and have $$$s = \color{red}{\mathtt{1}}\mathtt{00001}$$$. Teto cannot change $$$s_1$$$ because it is protected and she cannot change $$$s_6$$$ because there is $$$\mathtt{1}$$$ in the previous $$$k - 1$$$ elements ($$$\color{blue}{\mathtt{10000}}\mathtt{1}$$$).For the fourth testcase, you must protect $$$s_1,s_3,s_5,s_7$$$ and have $$$s = \mathtt{\color{red}{1}0\color{red}{1}0\color{red}{1}0\color{red}{1}}$$$. It can be shown that this is optimal. For example, if you did not protect $$$s_3$$$, then Teto can change it to $$$\mathtt{0}$$$ ($$$\mathtt{\color{red}{1}\color{blue}{0}10\color{red}{1}0\color{red}{1}}$$$)
