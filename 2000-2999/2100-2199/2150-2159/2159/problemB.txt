Then, the area of a rectangle $$$(u,d,l,r)$$$ is defined as $$$(d-u+1) \cdot (r-l+1)$$$.For example, consider the following binary grid given below.$$$$$$\begin{matrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \end{matrix}$$$$$$Here, you may see two rectangles $$$(1,2,1,3)$$$ and $$$(1,3,3,5)$$$$$$^{\text{†}}$$$, each of which has area $$$6$$$ and $$$9$$$, respectively.For each cell $$$(i,j)$$$, find the minimum area of any rectangle $$$(u,d,l,r)$$$ such that $$$u \le i \le d$$$ and $$$l \le j \le r$$$.$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A binary grid is a grid where each cell contains $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. The cell on the $$$j$$$-th column of the $$$i$$$-th row is denoted as cell $$$(i,j)$$$.$$$^{\text{†}}$$$Note that these are the only rectangles in the grid; for example, $$$(1,1,1,5)$$$ is not a rectangle as it does not satisfy $$$u<d$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le n,m$$$, $$$n\cdot m \le 250\,000$$$).Each of the $$$n$$$ following lines contains a string of length $$$m$$$ denoting the $$$i$$$-th row of $$$G$$$ ($$$G_{i,j} \in \{0,1\}$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n\cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$250\,000$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a grid of $$$n$$$ rows and $$$m$$$ columns. On the $$$j$$$-th column of the $$$i$$$-th row, you should output:  If there exists a rectangle $$$(u,d,l,r)$$$ such that $$$u \le i \le d$$$ and $$$l \le j \le r$$$, output the minimum area of any such rectangle;  Otherwise, output $$$0$$$ instead.
