You are controlling a chip that is initially in the cell $$$0$$$. There is a trap in each cell; they are activated according to the following rules:   at the end of moves $$$1, (1+n), (1+2n), \dots$$$, traps are activated in cells $$$x$$$ where $$$x \bmod a_1 = b_1$$$;  at the end of moves $$$2, (2+n), (2+2n), \dots$$$, traps are activated in cells $$$x$$$ where $$$x \bmod a_2 = b_2$$$;  $$$\cdots$$$  at the end of moves $$$n, (n+n), (n+2n), \dots$$$, traps are activated in cells $$$x$$$ where $$$x \bmod a_n= b_n$$$. In one turn, you can either move from the current cell to the next or stay in place. Then all the traps for this turn are activated. If the chip is in a cell with an activated trap at the beginning of the turn, the game ends. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of turns to reach the cell $$$m$$$, or report that it is impossible. If the chip reaches the cell $$$m$$$ and at the end of the same turn, a trap in the cell $$$m$$$ activates, it is not considered a valid way to reach the cell $$$m$$$.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10$$$; $$$1 \le m \le 10^{12}$$$).The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$2 \le a_i \le 10$$$).The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \le b_i < a_i$$$).OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of turns to reach cell $$$m$$$. If it is impossible, print -1.ExampleInput52 52 20 12 52 21 01 7324 2123981517133 2 5 20 1 3 02 43 40 0Output56-14247963034245
