B. Multiple Constructiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an integer $$$n$$$. Your task is to construct an array of length $$$2 \cdot n$$$ such that:  Each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly twice in the array.  For each integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le x \le n$$$), the distance between the two occurrences of $$$x$$$ is a multiple of $$$x$$$. In other words, if $$$p_x$$$ and $$$q_x$$$ are the indices of the two occurrences of $$$x$$$, $$$| q_x - p_x |$$$ must be divisible by $$$x$$$. It can be shown that a solution always exists.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. Each of the next $$$t$$$ lines contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{5}$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^{5}$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a line containing $$$2 \cdot n$$$ integers — the array that satisfies the given conditions.If there are multiple valid answers, print any of them.ExampleInput3

NoteVisualizer linkIn the first test case:   The number $$$1$$$ appears at positions $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$: the distance is $$$2$$$, which is divisible by $$$1$$$.  The number $$$2$$$ appears at positions $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$: the distance is $$$2$$$, which is divisible by $$$2$$$. In the second test case:   The number $$$1$$$ appears at positions $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$: the distance is $$$2$$$, which is divisible by $$$1$$$.  The number $$$2$$$ appears at positions $$$4$$$ and $$$6$$$: the distance is $$$2$$$, which is divisible by $$$2$$$.  The number $$$3$$$ appears at positions $$$2$$$ and $$$5$$$: the distance is $$$3$$$, which is divisible by $$$3$$$. In the third test case, the two occurrences of $$$1$$$ are at positions $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so the distance between them is $$$1$$$, which is a multiple of $$$1$$$.
