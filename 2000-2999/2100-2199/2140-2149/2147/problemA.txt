Formally, if we number steps from one in the order they are done, then odd-numbered steps must be along the $$$x$$$ axis and even-numbered steps must be along the $$$y$$$ axis.Additionally, each step must have a length strictly greater than the length of the previous one.Output the minimum number of steps needed to reach $$$(x, y)$$$, or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first and only line of each case contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \le x, y \le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, output the minimum number of steps to reach $$$(x, y)$$$ or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible.ExampleInput101 25 64 21 12 13 35 15 4752 1857295152 2322Output223-1-1-1-1-123NoteVisualizer linkIn the second test case, you can move to $$$(5, 0)$$$ by moving $$$5$$$ along the $$$x$$$ axis and then to $$$(5, 6)$$$ by moving $$$6$$$ along the $$$y$$$ axis.    In the third test case, you can move to $$$(1, 0)$$$, then to $$$(1, 2)$$$, and finally to $$$(4, 2)$$$.    In the fourth test case, reaching $$$(1, 1)$$$ is impossible since after moving to $$$(1, 0)$$$ along the $$$x$$$ axis, you are forced to move at least $$$2$$$ along the $$$y$$$ axis.
