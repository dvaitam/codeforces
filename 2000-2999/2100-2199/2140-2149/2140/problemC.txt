C. Ultimate Valuetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard output Let's define a function $$$f(a)$$$ for an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ as $$$$$$f(a) = \textrm{cost} + (a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 \cdots a_n)$$$$$$ where $$$\textrm{cost}$$$ is zero initially.Now consider the scenario where Alice and Bob are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. They play a game taking at most $$$10^{100}$$$ turns alternately with Alice going first.In each turn, they must perform any one (only one) of the following operations:   End the game for both Alice and Bob.  Choose two indices $$$l,r$$$ with $$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$ and swap $$$a_l$$$ and $$$a_r$$$; this adds $$$(r - l)$$$ to the $$$\textrm{cost}$$$. Assume that Alice tries to maximize $$$f(a)$$$ and Bob tries to minimize it. Your task is to determine the final value of $$$f(a)$$$ assuming both players play optimally.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot10^5$$$. OutputFor each testcase, output a single integer — the final value of $$$f(a)$$$ assuming both players play optimally.ExampleInput521000 159 9 9 9 947 1 8 461 14 1 14 1 15931 12 14 22 89 6 78 25 91Output999

NoteFor the first testcase, it is optimal for Alice to end the game on her first turn.So the final value of $$$\textrm{cost} = 0$$$ and $$$f(a) = 0 + 1000 - 1 = 999$$$.For the fourth testcase, it is optimal for Alice to swap $$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_6$$$, and then it is optimal for Bob to end the game on his first turn.So the final value of $$$\textrm{cost} = 5$$$ and $$$f(a) = 5 + 15 - 14 + 1 - 14 + 1 - 1=-7$$$.
