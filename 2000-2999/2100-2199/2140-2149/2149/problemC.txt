Find the minimum number of such operations required to satisfy the condition: $$$\operatorname{MEX}(a)$$$$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$$$$=k$$$$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$The minimum excluded (MEX) of a set of numbers $$$a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$$$ is the smallest non-negative integer $$$x$$$ that does not appear among the $$$a_i$$$.InputEach test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of sets of input data. The description of the sets of input data follows.The first line of each set of input data contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5,\,\, 0 \le k \le n$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the required $$$\operatorname{MEX}(a)$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le n$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $$$n$$$ across all sets of input data does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each set of input data, output one integer — the minimum number of operations required to satisfy the condition $$$\operatorname{MEX}(a)=k$$$.ExampleInput51 003 10 2 35 50 1 2 3 46 20 3 4 2 6 27 40 1 5 4 4 7 3Output10022NoteIn the first set of input data, the array $$$a=[0]$$$, so $$$\operatorname{MEX}=1$$$. $$$ \\ $$$ By removing zero (replacing it with any $$$x\in[1,n]$$$), we get $$$\operatorname{MEX}=0$$$. $$$ \\ $$$ Thus, exactly one operation is required.In the third set of input data, the array contains all the numbers $$$0,1,2,3,4$$$, so $$$\operatorname{MEX}(a)=5$$$ from the start. Since this matches the required $$$k$$$, no changes are needed and the minimum number of operations is $$$0$$$.
