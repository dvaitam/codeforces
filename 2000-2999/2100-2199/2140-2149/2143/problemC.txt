Max Treetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard output  You are given a tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Each of the $$$n - 1$$$ edges is associated with two non-negative integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.Consider a permutation$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of the integers $$$1$$$ through $$$n$$$, where $$$p_i$$$ represents the value assigned to vertex $$$i$$$.For an edge $$$(u, v)$$$, such that $$$u < v$$$ with associated values $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, its contribution is defined as follows: $$$$$$ \begin{cases} x & \text{if } p_u > p_v, \\ y & \text{otherwise.} \end{cases} $$$$$$The value of the permutation is the sum of the contributions from all edges.Your task is to find any permutation $$$p$$$ that maximizes this total value.$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array). InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.Each of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains four integers $$$u$$$, $$$v$$$, $$$x$$$, and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \le u < v \le n$$$, $$$1 \le x, y \le 10^9$$$) — describing an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ with associated values $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. It is guarranteed that the given edges form a tree.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$. OutputFor each test case, you must output a permutation $$$p$$$ of the integers $$$1$$$ through $$$n$$$ that maximizes the total value as defined in the problem. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.ExampleInput331 2 2 12 3 3 251 2 1 31 5 2 12 4 5 72 3 1 10052 5 5 23 5 4 64 5 1 51 5 3 5Output3 2 1 2 3 5 4 1 1 5 2 3 4 NoteIn the first test case:Consider the permutation $$$p = [3, 2, 1]$$$. Its value is $$$5 = 2 + 3$$$. Here's why:   Since $$$p_1 > p_2$$$, the first edge contributes $$$+2$$$.  Since $$$p_2 > p_3$$$, the second edge contributes $$$+3$$$. The values of some other permutations are as follows:   $$$p = [1, 2, 3]$$$ has value $$$1 + 2 = 3$$$.  $$$p = [1, 3, 2]$$$ has value $$$1 + 3 = 4$$$.  $$$p = [3, 1, 2]$$$ has value $$$2 + 2 = 4$$$. In the second test case:The value of $$$p = [2, 3, 5, 4, 1]$$$ is $$$3 + 2 + 7 + 100 = 112$$$. Another possible correct answer is $$$p = [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]$$$.
