Or determine that no such permutation exists.$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A binary string is a string where each character is either $$$\mathtt{0}$$$ or $$$\mathtt{1}$$$.$$$^{\text{†}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array). InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\le n \le 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the permutation.The second line contains the binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ ($$$s_i=\mathtt{0}$$$ or $$$\mathtt{1}$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$. OutputFor each test case:  If no such permutation exists, print "NO" in the only line of output.  Otherwise, print "YES" in the first line of output. Then output $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1\le p_i\le n$$$) in the second line — the permutation you constructed. You can output the token in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.ExampleInput6311150000051010070010000110000100110012011100010000OutputYES1 2 3 YES2 4 3 5 1NOYES2 1 3 5 7 6 4YES2 1 4 3 5 7 6 8 9 11 10NONoteIn the first test case, we have constructed $$$p=[1,2,3]$$$. Take $$$\text{find(2)}$$$ as an example:  In the beginning, $$$l=1$$$ and $$$r=3$$$;  We will select $$$m$$$ as a random integer between $$$l=1$$$ and $$$r=3$$$.   If we choose $$$m=1$$$:   $$$p_1=1< 2$$$, so $$$l$$$ is set to $$$m + 1 = 2$$$. Now $$$l=2$$$ and $$$r=3$$$;  We will select $$$m$$$ as a random integer between $$$l=2$$$ and $$$r=3$$$.  If we choose $$$m=2$$$: $$$p_2=2$$$, so the return value is $$$2$$$.  If we choose $$$m=3$$$: $$$p_3=3>2$$$, so $$$r$$$ is set to $$$m-1=2$$$. Now $$$l=2$$$ and $$$r=2$$$, so we can only select $$$m=2$$$. $$$p_2=2$$$, so the return value is $$$2$$$.   If we choose $$$m=2$$$:   $$$p_2=2$$$, so the return value is $$$2$$$.   If we choose $$$m=3$$$, the process is similar to that when $$$m=1$$$ is chosen. The return value is always $$$2$$$.   Thus, no matter how $$$m$$$ is selected during the process, the return value of $$$\text{find}(2)$$$ is always $$$2$$$. So $$$p_{\text{find}(2)}= p_2 = 2$$$ always holds, and the integer $$$2$$$ is stable. Similarly, we can show that integers $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$ are also stable. Thus, the permutation $$$p = [1, 2, 3]$$$ is a valid answer.In the second test case, we have constructed $$$p=[2,4,3,5,1]$$$. Take $$$\text{find(3)}$$$ as an example:   In the beginning, $$$l=1$$$ and $$$r=5$$$;  We will select $$$m$$$ as a random integer between $$$l=1$$$ and $$$r=5$$$. Let's choose $$$m=2$$$;  $$$p_2=4>3$$$, so $$$r$$$ is set to $$$m-1=1$$$. Now $$$l=1$$$ and $$$r=1$$$;  We will select $$$m$$$ as a random integer between $$$l=1$$$ and $$$r=1$$$. We can only choose $$$m=1$$$;  $$$p_1=2<3$$$, so $$$l$$$ is set to $$$m + 1 = 2$$$. Now $$$l=2$$$ and $$$r=1$$$;  Since $$$l>r$$$, the loop is exited and the return value is undefined. Thus, the return value of $$$\text{find}(3)$$$ is undefined, so the integer $$$3$$$ is not stable.Similarly, we can show that integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$, and $$$5$$$ are also not stable. Thus, $$$p = [2, 4, 3, 5, 1]$$$ is a valid answer.Some other permutations, such as $$$p=[5,4,3,2,1]$$$ and $$$p=[3,5,1,4,2]$$$, are also valid answers. You may print any of them.In the third test case, it can be proven that no such permutation exists.
