C1. Maple and Tree Beauty (Easy Version)time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard output   This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, the constraints on $$$t$$$ and $$$n$$$ are smaller. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem. Maple is given a rooted tree consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, where the root has index $$$1$$$. Each vertex of the tree is labeled either zero or one. Unfortunately, Maple forgot how the vertices are labeled and only remembers that there are exactly $$$k$$$ zeros and $$$n - k$$$ ones.For each vertex, we define the name of the vertex as the binary string formed by concatenating the labels of the vertices from the root to the vertex. More formally, $$$\text{name}_1 = \text{label}_1$$$ and $$$\text{name}_u = \text{name}_{p_u} + \text{label}_u$$$ for all $$$2\le u\le n$$$, where $$$p_u$$$ is the parent of vertex $$$u$$$ and $$$+$$$ represents string concatenation.The beauty of the tree is equal to the length of the longest common subsequence$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of the names of all the leaves$$$^{\text{†}}$$$. Your task is to determine the maximum beauty among all labelings of the tree with exactly $$$k$$$ zeros and $$$n - k$$$ ones.$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A sequence $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.  The longest common subsequence of strings $$$s_1, s_2, \ldots s_m$$$ is the longest string that is a subsequence of all of $$$s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_m$$$.$$$^{\text{†}}$$$A leaf is any vertex without children. InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 50$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 1000$$$, $$$0 \leq k \leq n$$$) — the number of vertices and the number of vertices labeled with zero, respectively.The second line contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_{n}$$$ ($$$1 \leq p_i \le i - 1$$$) — the parent of vertex $$$i$$$.Note that there are no constraints on the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer representing the maximum beauty among all labelings of the tree with exactly $$$k$$$ zeros and $$$n - k$$$ ones.ExamplesInput57 31 1 2 2 3 37 21 1 2 3 1 15 01 2 3 45 21 1 1 15 41 1 1 1Output3

Note   In the first test case, the maximum beauty is $$$3$$$, when the vertices are labeled with $$$[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]$$$, and the longest common subsequence is 001.   In the second test case, the maximum beauty is $$$2$$$, when the vertices are labeled with $$$[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]$$$, and the longest common subsequence is 11.
