D. Antiamuny and Slider Movementtime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard output Antiamuny is managing $$$n$$$ sliders on a one-dimensional track of length $$$m$$$. Each slider occupies exactly one unit of space and starts at a distinct position. The sliders are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and are arranged from left to right, so that the $$$i$$$-th slider is initially at position $$$a_i$$$.Antiamuny is given $$$q$$$ operations. Each operation is described by two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1\le i\le n$$$, $$$i \leq x \leq m - n + i$$$). The operation moves the $$$i$$$-th slider to position $$$x$$$. However, if this move causes a collision with another slider (i.e., if there is any other slider between the $$$i$$$-th slider's current position and the destination $$$x$$$), that obstructing slider is pushed in the same direction by one unit until it no longer causes a collision with the $$$i$$$-th slider. This can trigger a chain reaction, where one slider pushes another, and so on, until all sliders occupy distinct positions again.Importantly, note that the operations do not change the relative ordering of the sliders: the $$$i$$$-th slider from the left will remain as the $$$i$$$-th slider from the left. Furthermore, the constraints on $$$x$$$ ensure that all sliders always remain on the track, with positions between $$$1$$$ and $$$m$$$.For example, suppose the initial slider positions are $$$[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]$$$. If the fifth slider (at position $$$9$$$) is moved to position $$$6$$$, it will push the fourth slider from $$$7$$$ to $$$5$$$, which in turn pushes the third slider from $$$5$$$ to $$$4$$$. The resulting positions become $$$[1, 3, \textbf{4}, \textbf{5}, \textbf{6}]$$$.Unfortunately, Antiamuny has forgotten the order in which the $$$q$$$ operations were applied. To recover the results, he decides to independently simulate each of the $$$q!$$$ possible permutations of the operations. For each permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$q$$$$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$, define $$$f_i(p)$$$ as the final position of the $$$i$$$-th slider after applying the operations in the order specified by $$$p$$$.In other words, starting from the initial positions of $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$, Antiamuny first applies the $$$p_1$$$-th operation, then the $$$p_2$$$-th operation, and so on, until the $$$p_q$$$-th operation. The value of $$$f_i(p)$$$ is the position of the $$$i$$$-th slider at the end of this sequence of operations.Your task is to compute, for each slider $$$i$$$ ($$$1\le i\le n$$$), the sum of $$$f_i(p)$$$ over all $$$q!$$$ permutations $$$p$$$ of the operations. Since the result can be large, output each sum modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$q$$$ is an array consisting of $$$q$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$q$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$q=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array). InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq n,q \leq 5 \cdot 10^3$$$, $$$n \leq m \leq 10^9$$$) — the number of sliders, the length of the track, and the number of operations, respectively.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \leq m$$$) — the initial positions of each slider. Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$, $$$i \leq x \leq m - n + i$$$) — the index of the slider to move, and the position to move the slider to, respectively.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5\cdot 10^3$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers, where the $$$i$$$-th of which represents the sum of $$$f_i(p)$$$ over all $$$q!$$$ permutations $$$p$$$ of the operations, modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.ExampleInput35 10 31 3 5 7 95 62 61 45 10 52 3 5 7 91 64 73 35 74 93 1000000000 31 10 2537463923 1000000003 10000000003 500000000Output18 29 35 41 47

NoteIn the first test case: If the operations are done in order $$$[2,1,3]$$$, we first apply the second operation which moves the $$$2$$$-nd slider to position $$$6$$$; then apply the first operation, which moves the $$$5$$$-th slider to position $$$6$$$; and finally apply the third operation, which moves the $$$1$$$-st slider to position $$$4$$$. The positions of the sliders after each operation are shown in the figure below. The final positions of the sliders will be $$$[4,5,6,7,8]$$$.   If the operations are done in order $$$[1,2,3]$$$, the final positions of the sliders will be $$$[4,6,7,8,9]$$$. If the operations are done in order $$$[1,3,2]$$$, the final positions of the sliders will be $$$[4,6,7,8,9]$$$. If the operations are done in order $$$[2,3,1]$$$, the final positions of the sliders will be $$$[2,3,4,5,6]$$$. If the operations are done in order $$$[3,1,2]$$$, the final positions of the sliders will be $$$[2,6,7,8,9]$$$. If the operations are done in order $$$[3,2,1]$$$, the final positions of the sliders will be $$$[2,3,4,5,6]$$$.For slider $$$1$$$, the sum of positions of the $$$6$$$ different scenarios is $$$4+4+4+2+2+2=18$$$.For slider $$$2$$$, the sum of positions of the $$$6$$$ different scenarios is $$$5+6+6+3+6+3=29$$$.For slider $$$3$$$, the sum of positions of the $$$6$$$ different scenarios is $$$6+7+7+4+7+4=35$$$.For slider $$$4$$$, the sum of positions of the $$$6$$$ different scenarios is $$$7+8+8+5+8+5=41$$$.For slider $$$5$$$, the sum of positions of the $$$6$$$ different scenarios is $$$8+9+9+6+9+6=47$$$.
