A. Maple and Multiplicationtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMaple has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. She may perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero) to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$:  Choose any positive integer $$$x$$$, and multiply either $$$a$$$ or $$$b$$$ by $$$x$$$. Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$. It can be proven that this is always possible.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b \le 1000$$$) — the numbers Maple currently has.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum number of operations Maple needs to make $$$a$$$ equal to $$$b$$$.ExampleInput31 210 31000 1000Output1

NoteIn the first test case, you can multiply $$$a=1$$$ by $$$2$$$ to obtain $$$a=b=2$$$. This requires one operation.In the second test case, you can multiply $$$a=10$$$ by $$$300$$$ to get $$$a = 3000$$$, then multiply $$$b=3$$$ by $$$1000$$$ to get $$$b=3000$$$. This requires two operations. Note that the numbers may exceed $$$1000$$$ after the operations.In the third test case, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are already equal, so no operations are required.
