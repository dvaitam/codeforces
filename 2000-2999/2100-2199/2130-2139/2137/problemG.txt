G. Cry Me a Rivertime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is a directed acyclic graph with $$$n$$$ nodes and $$$m$$$ edges. Each node is initially colored blue.Let's define the fun graph game as follows:  Initially, a token is placed on node $$$s$$$.  Cry and River take turns moving the token to a node such that there exists a directed edge from its current position to that node, with Cry going first.  Cry wins if the token ever reaches a node with no outgoing edges, after either player's turn.  River wins if the token reaches a red node after either player's turn.  If the players reach a node that is both red and does not have outgoing edges, River wins. Since the graph is acyclic, it can be shown that the game always ends in a finite number of turns. Note that Cry and River can win the game immediately if the starting node $$$s$$$ doesn't have outgoing edges, or is red respectively.You must handle $$$q$$$ queries of the following kind:  1 u: update the color of node $$$u$$$ to red. It is guaranteed that node $$$u$$$ was blue before this update.  2 u: If a fun graph game is played with the token initially at node $$$u$$$, and both players play optimally, does Cry win? InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^5$$$ ,$$$1 \leq m,q \leq 2\cdot 10^5$$$).The following $$$m$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \leq u,v \leq n$$$), meaning that there is an edge from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$. The following $$$q$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \leq x \leq 2, 1 \leq u \leq n$$$) – denoting the type of query and the node that the query is done on.It is guaranteed that the given graph is a directed acyclic graph. Additionally, no edge is given more than once.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$, the sum of $$$m$$$, and the sum of $$$q$$$ each do not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$ over all test cases.OutputFor each query of the second type, output YES if Cry wins. Otherwise, output NO. Each letter may be outputted in uppercase or lowercase.ExampleInput17 8 101 21 31 42 53 65 72 33 42 11 31 42 12 22 32 42 52 62 7OutputYES

NoteBelow shows the graph in the sample.     Initially, all nodes are blue. Thus, Cry cannot lose, and eventually the token will be moved to a node without outgoing edges.After nodes $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$ are painted red, the nodes $$$1,3,4$$$ now start off as a win for River when playing optimally. If the game starts at nodes $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$, River wins immediately. If the game starts at node $$$1$$$, one way the game can go is as follows:  Cry moves the token to node $$$2$$$.  River moves the token to node $$$3$$$, which is red, so River wins. .It can be shown that Cry still wins with optimal play for all other nodes.
