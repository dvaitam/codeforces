Note that you can choose different values for each element of the array $$$b$$$.Your task is to perform at most $$$k$$$ such operations to make $$$\gcd(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) > 1$$$ $$$^{\text{∗}}$$$. It can be proved that this is always possible.Output the final array after the operations. You do not have to output the operations themselves.$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$$$$\gcd(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$$$ denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \leq k \leq 10^9$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the given constant.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$. OutputFor each test case, output an array of $$$n$$$ integers in a new line — the final array after the operations. The integers in the output should be within the range from $$$1$$$ to $$$10^9 + k^2$$$.If there are multiple valid outputs, you can output any of them.Note that you do not have to minimize the number of operations.ExampleInput83 32 7 14 52 9 16 144 11 2 3 45 25 6 7 8 92 107 91 100000000011 37110000000003 61 3 5Output8 10 10

NoteIn the first test case, the output $$$[8,10,10]$$$ is valid because $$$\gcd(8, 10, 10) = 2 > 1$$$, and the array $$$[2, 7, 1]$$$ can be transformed into $$$[8, 10, 10]$$$ using at most $$$3$$$ operations. One possible sequence of operations is shown below: Operation$$$b$$$Resulting $$$a$$$$$$1$$$$$$[3,0,3]$$$$$$[5,7,4]$$$$$$2$$$$$$[0,0,3]$$$$$$[5,7,7]$$$$$$3$$$$$$[3,3,3]$$$$$$[8,10,10]$$$ Other outputs like $$$[2, 10, 4]$$$, $$$[8, 16, 4]$$$, and $$$[5, 10, 10]$$$ are also considered valid.In the second test case, the output $$$[7, 14, 21, 14]$$$ is valid because:  $$$\gcd(7, 14, 21, 14) = 7 > 1$$$.  Starting from $$$[2, 9, 16, 14]$$$, applying the operation with $$$b = [5, 5, 5, 0]$$$ yields $$$[7, 14, 21, 14]$$$, requiring no more than $$$5$$$ operations.
