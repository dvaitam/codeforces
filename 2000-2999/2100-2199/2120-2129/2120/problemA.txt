A. Square of Rectanglestime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAryan is an ardent lover of squares but a hater of rectangles (Yes, he knows all squares are rectangles). But Harshith likes to mess with Aryan. Harshith gives Aryan three rectangles of sizes $$$l_1\times b_1$$$, $$$l_2\times b_2$$$, and $$$l_3\times b_3$$$ such that $$$l_3\leq l_2\leq l_1$$$ and $$$b_3\leq b_2\leq b_1$$$. Aryan, in order to defeat Harshith, decides to arrange these three rectangles to form a square such that no two rectangles overlap and the rectangles are aligned along edges. Rotating rectangles is not allowed. Help Aryan determine if he can defeat Harshith.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows. Each test case contains a single line with $$$6$$$ space-separated integers $$$l_1, b_1, l_2, b_2, l_3$$$, and $$$b_3$$$ ($$$1 \leq l_3\le l_2\le l_1\le 100$$$, $$$1\le b_3\le b_2\le b_1 \leq 100$$$) — the dimensions of the three rectangles.OutputFor each testcase, print "YES" if the rectangles can be arranged to form a square; otherwise, "NO".You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.ExampleInput5100 100 10 10 1 15 3 5 1 5 12 3 1 2 1 18 5 3 5 3 33 3 3 3 2 1OutputNO

NoteIn the second test case, the three rectangles $$$5\times 3$$$, $$$5\times 1$$$, and $$$5\times 1$$$ can be arranged as follows to form a square.  In the fourth test case, it can be proven that the rectangles can't be arranged to form a square with the given constraints.
