B. No Casino in the Mountainstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ numbers and a number $$$k$$$. The value $$$a_i$$$ describes the weather on the $$$i$$$-th day: if it rains on the $$$i$$$-th day, then $$$a_i = 1$$$; otherwise, if the weather is good on the $$$i$$$-th day, then $$$a_i = 0$$$.Jean wants to visit as many peaks as possible. One hike to a peak takes exactly $$$k$$$ days, and during each of these days, the weather must be good ($$$a_i = 0$$$). That is, formally, he can start a hike on day $$$i$$$ only if all $$$a_j = 0$$$ for all $$$j$$$ $$$(i \leq j \leq i + k - 1)$$$.After each hike, before starting the next one, Jean must take a break of at least one day, meaning that on the day following a hike, he cannot go on another hike.Find the maximum number of peaks that Jean can visit.InputEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le k \le n$$$). The second line contains $$$n$$$ numbers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$a_i \in \{0, 1\}$$$), where $$$a_i$$$ denotes the weather on the $$$i$$$-th day.It is guaranteed that the total value of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of hikes that Jean can make.ExampleInput55 10 1 0 0 07 30 0 0 0 0 0 03 11 1 14 20 1 0 16 20 0 1 0 0 0Output3

2NoteIn the first sample:   Day $$$1$$$ — good weather, Jean goes on a hike. ($$$a_1 = 0$$$)  Day $$$2$$$ — mandatory break.  Day $$$3$$$ — again good weather, Jean goes on the second hike. ($$$a_3 = 0$$$)  Day $$$4$$$ — break.  Day $$$5$$$ — good weather, third hike. ($$$a_5 = 0$$$)  Thus, Jean can make 3 hikes, alternating each with a mandatory day of rest. In the second sample:   From day $$$1$$$ to day $$$3$$$ — three days of good weather, Jean goes on a hike. ($$$a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = 0$$$)  Day $$$4$$$ — mandatory break.  From day $$$5$$$ to day $$$7$$$ — again three days of good weather, Jean goes on the second hike. ($$$a_5 = a_6 = a_7 = 0$$$)  In total, Jean makes 2 hikes.  In the third sample:   There are no days with good weather ($$$a_i = 1$$$ for all $$$i$$$)  Jean cannot make any hikes. Answer: 0
