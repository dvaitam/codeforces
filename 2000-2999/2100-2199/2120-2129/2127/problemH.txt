The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 50$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$3 \leq n \leq 30$$$, $$$n-1 \leq m \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$$) — the number of vertices and the number of edges.Then $$$m$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th line containing two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \leq u, v \leq n$$$) — the two vertices that the $$$i$$$-th edge connects.It is guaranteed that the given graph is simple and connected, and each vertex belongs to at most $$$5$$$ simple cycles.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$900$$$. OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of edges among all subgraphs that are candy graphs.ExampleInput34 41 21 32 33 47 101 21 31 42 43 44 54 65 65 76 79 101 21 33 43 74 54 65 67 87 98 9Output3

NoteIn the first test case, you can select the edges marked in the image below. On the other hand, you can't select all the edges because the degree of vertex $$$3$$$ would exceed $$$2$$$. So the maximum number of edges among all subgraphs that are candy is $$$3$$$.   In the second test case, you can select the edges marked in the image below. It can be proven that any subgraph that is candy has at most $$$7$$$ edges.   In the third test case, the image below shows one of the subgraphs with the maximum possible number of edges that is candy.
