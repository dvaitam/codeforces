Formally, $$$f(S)$$$ is the number of integers $$$x$$$ such that there exists an $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \leq i \leq m$$$) where $$$[x, x+1] \subseteq [a_i, b_i]$$$.  Treating each $$$(a_i, b_i)$$$ as an undirected edge in a graph, $$$g(S)$$$ is the number of nodes that lie on at least one simple cycle with at least $$$3$$$ edges. Formally, $$$g(S)$$$ is the number of nodes $$$x_1$$$ such that there exists a path $$$x_1 \to x_2 \to \ldots \to x_k \to x_1$$$ in the graph, where $$$k \geq 3$$$ and all $$$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k$$$ are distinct. For example, $$$S = \{(1,2), (2,4), (1,4), (4,5),(6,7)\}$$$, we can get $$$f(S) = 5$$$ and $$$g(S) = 3$$$.You are given $$$n$$$ distinct pairs. Your task is to select a subset $$$S'$$$ of these pairs such that $$$f(S') - g(S')$$$ is maximized. You need to output the indices of the selected pairs.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^3$$$).Next $$$n$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$a_i$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i < b_i \le 2n$$$), representing a pair.It is guaranteed that all pairs are distinct within the same test case.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n^2$$$ over all test cases will not exceed $$$9 \cdot 10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, the first line contains an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \le k \le n$$$) — the size of the subset $$$S'$$$.Next line contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_m$$$ ($$$1 \le i_1 , i_2 , \ldots , i_k \le n$$$) — the indices of the selected pairs. Note the indices must be distinct.ExampleInput211 241 22 31 33 5Output1

NoteIn the first test case, if no pair is selected (i.e. $$$S'=\varnothing$$$), $$$f(S')-g(S')=0-0=0$$$. If the first pair is selected, $$$f (S') - g (S')=1-0=1$$$. So the optimal solution is to select the first pair.
