Modular Sortingtime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$2\leq m\leq 5\cdot 10^5$$$) and an array $$$a$$$ consisting of nonnegative integers smaller than $$$m$$$.Answer queries of the following form:   $$$1$$$ $$$i$$$ $$$x$$$: assign $$$a_i := x$$$  $$$2$$$ $$$k$$$: in one operation, you may choose an element $$$a_i$$$ and assign $$$a_i := (a_i + k) \pmod m$$$$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ — determine if there exists some sequence of (possibly zero) operations to make $$$a$$$ nondecreasing$$$^{\text{†}}$$$. Note that instances of query $$$2$$$ are independent; that is, no actual operations are taking place. Instances of query $$$1$$$ are persistent.$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$$$$a\pmod m$$$ is defined as the unique integer $$$b$$$ such that $$$0\leq b<m$$$ and $$$a-b$$$ is an integer multiple of $$$m$$$.$$$^{\text{†}}$$$An array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ is called nondecreasing if and only if $$$a_i\leq a_{i+1}$$$ for all $$$1\leq i<n$$$.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\leq t\leq 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains three integers, $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, and $$$q$$$ ($$$2\leq n \leq 10^5$$$, $$$2\leq m\leq 5\cdot10^5$$$, $$$1\leq q\leq 10^5$$$) — the size of the array $$$a$$$, the integer $$$m$$$, and the number of queries.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers, $$$a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$0\leq a_i < m$$$).Then follows $$$q$$$ lines. Each line is of one of the following forms:   $$$1$$$ $$$i$$$ $$$x$$$ ($$$1\leq i\leq n$$$, $$$0\leq x<m$$$)  $$$2$$$ $$$k$$$ ($$$1\leq k<m$$$) It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases each do not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each instance of query $$$2$$$, output on a single line "YES" if there exists some sequence of (possibly zero) operations to make $$$a$$$ nondecreasing, and "NO" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.ExampleInput27 6 64 5 2 2 4 1 02 41 4 52 42 31 7 22 38 8 30 1 2 3 4 5 6 72 41 3 42 4OutputYES

NoteIn the first sample, the array is initially: 4522410By applying the operation twice on $$$a_1$$$, twice on $$$a_2$$$, once on $$$a_5$$$, twice on $$$a_6$$$, and once on $$$a_7$$$, the array becomes: 0122234 which is in nondecreasing order.After the second query, the array becomes: 4525410 and it can be shown that it is impossible to sort this with operations of the form $$$a_i := (a_i+4)\pmod 6$$$, and it is also impossible to sort this with operations of the form $$$a_i := (a_i+3)\pmod 6$$$.
