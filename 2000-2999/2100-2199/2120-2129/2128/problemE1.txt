E1. Submedians (Easy Version)time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version, you are asked to find a subarray only for the maximum submedian.You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.An integer $$$v$$$ is a median of an array $$$b$$$ of length $$$m$$$ if and only if:   $$$v$$$ is greater than or equal to at least $$$\lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil$$$ elements of the array, and  $$$v$$$ is less than or equal to at least $$$\lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil$$$ elements of the array.  For instance:   the only median of $$$[9, 3, 7]$$$ is $$$7$$$,  the medians of $$$[5, 3, 7, 9]$$$ are $$$5$$$, $$$6$$$, and $$$7$$$, and  the only median of $$$[2, 2, 2]$$$ is $$$2$$$. You're given an integer $$$k$$$ and an array $$$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$$ of integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$.An integer $$$v$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ is said to be a submedian if there exists at least one pair of indices $$$(l, r)$$$ such that   $$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$,  $$$r - l + 1 \geq k$$$,  $$$v$$$ is a median of the subarray $$$[a_l, \ldots, a_r]$$$. It can be proven that there always exists at least one submedian. Find the maximum submedian $$$v_\max$$$ and any corresponding pair of indices $$$(l, r)$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 50\,000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq k \leq n \leq 300\,000$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$300\,000$$$.OutputFor each test case, output three integers $$$v_\max$$$, $$$l$$$, and $$$r$$$ — the maximum submedian $$$v_\max$$$ and the bounds of a subarray of length at least $$$k$$$ ($$$r - l + 1 \geq k$$$) such that $$$v_\max$$$ is one of its medians.If there are many solutions, you can print any of them.ExampleInput74 34 1 2 45 21 2 3 2 15 31 2 3 2 15 31 1 2 5 31 112 12 14 11 2 1 3Output4 1 4

NoteIn the first test case, the subarrays of length at least $$$k = 3$$$ are   $$$(l = 1, r = 3)$$$: $$$[4, 1, 2]$$$ whose only median is $$$2$$$,  $$$(l = 2, r = 4)$$$: $$$[1, 2, 4]$$$ whose only median is $$$2$$$, and  $$$(l = 1, r = 4)$$$: $$$[4, 1, 2, 4]$$$ whose medians are $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$, and $$$4$$$. In the second test case, one possible output is $$$(l = 3, r = 4)$$$ whose medians are $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$.Note that it can be proven that no subarray of length at least $$$2$$$ admits $$$4$$$ or $$$5$$$ as a median.
