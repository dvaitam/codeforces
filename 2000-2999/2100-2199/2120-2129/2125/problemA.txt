A. Difficult Contesttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIt is known that a contest can be represented by a string $$$s$$$, consisting of uppercase Latin letters that denote problems. It is also known that a contest is difficult if it contains "FFT" or "NTT" as a contiguous substring.Your task is to rearrange the problem in contest $$$s$$$ in such a way that this contest is not difficult. If the initial contest is not difficult, you may leave it as it is.InputEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^{4}$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le |s| \le 2 \cdot 10^{5}$$$).Additional constraints on the input data:  the total length of strings across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^{5}$$$. OutputFor each test case, output a string — a non-difficult contest that was obtained from $$$s$$$ by rearranging the letters.If there are multiple correct answers, you may output any. It can be shown that at least one correct answer always exists.ExampleInput5FFTABFBANTTAFFTNTTFFTFFTFFTNNTNNTAFFTBFFNTTFTTZOutputFTF
