B. Gellyfish and Baby's Breathtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFlower gives Gellyfish two permutations$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of $$$[0, 1, \ldots, n-1]$$$: $$$p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}$$$ and $$$q_0, q_1, \ldots, q_{n-1}$$$.Now Gellyfish wants to calculate an array $$$r_0,r_1,\ldots,r_{n-1}$$$ through the following method:  For all $$$i$$$ ($$$0 \leq i \leq n-1$$$), $$$r_i = \max\limits_{j=0}^{i} \left(2^{p_j} + 2^{q_{i-j}} \right)$$$ But since Gellyfish is very lazy, you have to help her figure out the elements of $$$r$$$.Since the elements of $$$r$$$ are very large, you are only required to output the elements of $$$r$$$ modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$An array $$$b$$$ is a permutation of an array $$$a$$$ if $$$b$$$ consists of the elements of $$$a$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[4,2,3,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$[3,2,4,4]$$$ while $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation of $$$[1,2,3]$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_0, p_1, \ldots,p_{n-1}$$$ ($$$0 \leq p_i < n$$$).The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$q_0, q_1, \ldots,q_{n-1}$$$ ($$$0 \leq q_i < n$$$).It is guaranteed that both $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are permutations of $$$[0, 1, \ldots, n-1]$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$r_0, r_1, \ldots, r_{n-1}$$$ in a single line, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.ExampleInput330 2 11 2 050 1 2 3 44 3 2 1 0105 8 9 3 4 0 2 7 1 69 5 1 4 0 3 2 8 7 6Output3 6 8

NoteIn the first test case:   $$$r_0 = 2^{p_0} + 2^{q_0} = 1+2=3$$$  $$$r_1 = \max(2^{p_0} + 2^{q_1}, 2^{p_1} + 2^{q_0}) = \max(1+4, 4+2) = 6$$$  $$$r_2 = \max(2^{p_0} + 2^{q_2}, 2^{p_1}+2^{q_1}, 2^{p_2}+2^{q_0}) = (1+1, 4+4, 2+2) = 8$$$
