A. Gellyfish and Flaming Peonytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGellyfish hates math problems, but she has to finish her math homework:Gellyfish is given an array of $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$.She needs to do the following two-step operation until all elements of $$$a$$$ are equal:  Select two indexes $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$ satisfying $$$1 \leq i, j \leq n$$$ and $$$i \neq j$$$.  Replace $$$a_i$$$ with $$$\gcd(a_i, a_j)$$$. Now, Gellyfish asks you for the minimum number of operations to achieve her goal.It can be proven that Gellyfish can always achieve her goal.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 5000$$$) — the length of the array.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 5000$$$) — the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations to achieve her goal.ExampleInput3312 20 3061 9 1 9 8 136 14 15Output4

NoteIn the first test case, the following is a way that minimizes the number of operations:   Choose $$$i = 3$$$ and $$$j=2$$$ and replace $$$a_3$$$ with $$$\gcd(a_3,a_2) = \gcd(30, 20) = 10$$$, then $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[12, 20, 10]$$$.  Choose $$$i=1$$$ and $$$j=3$$$ and replace $$$a_1$$$ with $$$\gcd(a_1,a_3) = \gcd(12, 10) = 2$$$, then $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[2, 20, 10]$$$.  Choose $$$i=2$$$ and $$$j=1$$$ and replace $$$a_2$$$ with $$$\gcd(a_2,a_1) = \gcd(20, 2) = 2$$$, then $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[2, 2, 10]$$$.  Choose $$$i=3$$$ and $$$j=1$$$ and replace $$$a_3$$$ with $$$\gcd(a_3,a_1) = \gcd(10, 2) = 2$$$, then $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[2, 2, 2]$$$.
