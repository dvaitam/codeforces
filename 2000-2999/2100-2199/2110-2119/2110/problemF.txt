Here is one of the entrance tasks for this faculty:We define the beauty of an array of positive integers $$$b$$$ as the maximum $$$f(b_i, b_j)$$$ over all pairs $$$1 \leq i, j \leq n$$$, where $$$f(x, y) = (x \bmod y) + (y \bmod x)$$$.Given an array of positive integers $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, output $$$n$$$ numbers, where the $$$i$$$-th number ($$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$) is the beauty of the array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_i$$$.$$$x \bmod y$$$ is the remainder of the division of $$$x$$$ by $$$y$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^6$$$) — the size of the array $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers — the beauties of all prefixes of the array $$$a$$$.ExampleInput253 1 4 1 575 11 11 4 2 1 10Output0 1 4 4 5

NoteThe beauty of the array $$$3$$$ is $$$0$$$.The beauty of the array $$$3, 1$$$ is $$$f(3, 1) = 1$$$.The beauty of the array $$$3, 1, 4$$$ is $$$f(3, 4) = 4$$$.The beauty of the array $$$3, 1, 4, 1$$$ is $$$f(4, 3) = 4$$$.The beauty of the array $$$3, 1, 4, 1, 5$$$ is $$$f(4, 5) = 5$$$.
