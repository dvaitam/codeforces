A. Energy Crystalstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere are three energy crystals numbered $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, and $$$3$$$; let's denote the energy level of the $$$i$$$-th crystal as $$$a_i$$$. Initially, all of them are discharged, meaning their energy levels are equal to $$$0$$$. Each crystal needs to be charged to level $$$x$$$ (exactly $$$x$$$, not greater).In one action, you can increase the energy level of any one crystal by any positive amount; however, the energy crystals are synchronized with each other, so an action can only be performed if the following condition is met afterward:  for each pair of crystals $$$i$$$, $$$j$$$, it must hold that $$$a_{i} \ge \lfloor\frac{a_{j}}{2}\rfloor$$$. What is the minimum number of actions required to charge all the crystals?InputEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^{4}$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le x \le 10^{9}$$$).OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of actions required to charge all energy crystals to level $$$x$$$.ExampleInput715142025314155368709101000000000Output3

NoteIn the first test case, one possible sequence of actions is:$$$$$$[0, 0, 0] \to [\color{red}{1}, 0, 0] \to [1, 0, \color{red}{1}] \to [1, \color{red}{1}, 1]$$$$$$One of the possible sequences of actions in the second test case is:$$$$$$[0, 0, 0] \to [\color{red}{1}, 0, 0] \to [1, \color{red}{1}, 0] \to [1, 1, \color{red}{2}] \to [\color{red}{3}, 1, 2] \to [3, \color{red}{5}, 2] \to [\color{red}{5}, 5, 2] \to [5, 5, \color{red}{5}]$$$$$$
