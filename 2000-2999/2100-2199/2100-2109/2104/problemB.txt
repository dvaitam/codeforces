B. Move to the Endtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ integers.For every integer $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, you have to do the following:  choose an arbitrary element of $$$a$$$ and move it to the right end of the array (you can choose the last element, then the array won't change);  print the sum of $$$k$$$ last elements of $$$a$$$;  move the element you've chosen on the first step to its original position (restore the original array $$$a$$$). For every $$$k$$$, you choose the element which you move so that the value you print is the maximum possible.Calculate the value you print for every $$$k$$$.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines:  the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$);  the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$). Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, print $$$n$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th of these integers should be equal to the maximum value you can print if $$$k=i$$$.ExampleInput4713 5 10 14 8 15 1361000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 100000000014227 5Output15 28 42 50 63 73 78

NoteLet's consider the first test case from the statement:  when $$$k = 1$$$, you can move the $$$6$$$-th element to the end, the array becomes $$$[13, 5, 10, 14, 8, 13, 15]$$$, and the value you print is $$$15$$$;  when $$$k = 2$$$, you can move the $$$6$$$-th element to the end, the array becomes $$$[13, 5, 10, 14, 8, 13, 15]$$$, and the value you print is $$$13 + 15 = 28$$$;  when $$$k = 3$$$, you can move the $$$4$$$-th element to the end, the array becomes $$$[13, 5, 10, 8, 15, 13, 14]$$$, and the value you print is $$$15 + 13 + 14 = 42$$$;  when $$$k = 4$$$, you can move the $$$5$$$-th element to the end, the array becomes $$$[13, 5, 10, 14, 15, 13, 8]$$$, and the value you print is $$$14 + 15 + 13 + 8 = 50$$$;  when $$$k = 5$$$, you can move the $$$1$$$-st element to the end, the array becomes $$$[5, 10, 14, 8, 15, 13, 13]$$$, and the value you print is $$$14 + 8 + 15 + 13 + 13 = 63$$$;  when $$$k = 6$$$, you can move the $$$1$$$-st element to the end, the array becomes $$$[5, 10, 14, 8, 15, 13, 13]$$$, and the value you print is $$$10 + 14 + 8 + 15 + 13 + 13 = 73$$$;  when $$$k = 7$$$, you can move the $$$6$$$-th element to the end, the array becomes $$$[13, 5, 10, 14, 8, 13, 15]$$$, and the value you print is $$$13 + 5 + 10 + 14 + 8 + 13 + 15 = 78$$$.
