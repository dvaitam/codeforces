C. Maximum Subarray Sumtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given an array $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and a positive integer $$$k$$$, but some parts of the array $$$a$$$ are missing. Your task is to fill the missing part so that the maximum subarray sum$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of $$$a$$$ is exactly $$$k$$$, or report that no solution exists.Formally, you are given a binary string $$$s$$$ and a partially filled array $$$a$$$, where:  If you remember the value of $$$a_i$$$, $$$s_i = 1$$$ to indicate that, and you are given the real value of $$$a_i$$$.  If you don't remember the value of $$$a_i$$$, $$$s_i = 0$$$ to indicate that, and you are given $$$a_i = 0$$$. All the values that you remember satisfy $$$|a_i| \le 10^6$$$. However, you may use values up to $$$10^{18}$$$ to fill in the values that you do not remember. It can be proven that if a solution exists, a solution also exists satisfying $$$|a_i| \le 10^{18}$$$. $$$^{\text{∗}}$$$The maximum subarray sum of an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$, i.e. $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n$$$ is defined as $$$\max_{1 \le i \le j \le n} S(i, j)$$$ where $$$S(i, j) = a_i + a_{i + 1} + \ldots + a_j$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two numbers $$$n,k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5,1 \le k \le 10^{12}$$$).The second line of each test case contains a binary ($$$\texttt{01}$$$) string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$.The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ numbers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$|a_i| \le 10^6$$$). If $$$s_i = \texttt{0}$$$, then it's guaranteed that $$$a_i = 0$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, first output $$$\texttt{Yes}$$$ if a solution exists or $$$\texttt{No}$$$ if no solution exists. You may print each character in either case, for example $$$\texttt{YES}$$$ and $$$\texttt{yEs}$$$ will also be accepted.If there's at least one solution, print $$$n$$$ numbers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ on the second line. $$$|a_i| \le 10^{18}$$$ must hold.ExampleInput103 50110 0 15 6110114 -3 0 -2 14 400110 0 -4 -56 121101111 2 0 5 -1 95 19000000 0 0 0 05 1911001-8 6 0 0 -55 101010110 0 10 0 101 1103 51113 -1 34 51011-2 0 1 -5OutputYes

NoteIn test case $$$1$$$, only the first position is not filled. We can fill it with $$$4$$$ to get the array $$$[4, 0, 1]$$$ which has maximum subarray sum of $$$5$$$.In test case $$$2$$$, only the third position is not filled. We can fill it with $$$5$$$ to get the array $$$[4, -3, 5, -2, 1]$$$. Here the maximum subarray sum comes from the subarray $$$[4, -3, 5]$$$ and it is $$$6$$$, as required.In test case $$$3$$$, the first and second positions are unfilled. We can fill both with $$$2$$$ to get the array $$$[2, 2, -4, -5]$$$ which has a maximum subarray sum of $$$4$$$. Note that other outputs are also possible such as $$$[0, 4, -4, -5]$$$.In test case $$$4$$$, it is impossible to get a valid array. For example, if we filled the third position with $$$0$$$, we get $$$[1, 2, 0, 5, -1, 9]$$$, but this has a maximum subarray sum of $$$16$$$, not $$$12$$$ as required.
