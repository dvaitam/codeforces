D. Apple Tree Traversingtime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is an apple tree with $$$n$$$ nodes, initially with one apple at each node. You have a paper with you, initially with nothing written on it.You are traversing on the apple tree, by doing the following action as long as there is at least one apple left:  Choose an apple path $$$(u,v)$$$. A path $$$(u,v)$$$ is called an apple path if and only if for every node on the path $$$(u,v)$$$, there's an apple on it.  Let $$$d$$$ be the number of apples on the path, write down three numbers $$$(d,u,v)$$$, in this order, on the paper.  Then remove all the apples on the path $$$(u,v)$$$. Here, the path $$$(u, v)$$$ refers to the sequence of vertices on the unique shortest walk from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$. Let the number sequence on the paper be $$$a$$$. Your task is to find the lexicographically largest possible sequence $$$a$$$. InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a number $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 1.5 \cdot 10^5$$$).The following $$$n-1$$$ lines of each test case contain two numbers $$$u,v$$$ ($$$1 \le u,v \le n$$$). It's guaranteed that the input forms a tree.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1.5 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the lexicographically largest sequence possible $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{|a|}$$$. It can be shown that $$$|a| \le 3 \cdot n$$$.ExampleInput641 21 31 442 12 42 351 22 33 44 5186 33 55 44 25 11 83 763 22 62 55 44 1Output3 4 3 1 2 2

NoteIn the first test case, we do the following steps:  Choose the apple path $$$(4, 3)$$$. This path consists of the nodes $$$4, 1, 3$$$, and each of them have an apple (so it is a valid apple path). $$$d = 3$$$ as there are $$$3$$$ apples on this path. Append $$$3, 4, 3$$$ in that order to our sequence $$$a$$$. Now, remove the apples from these $$$3$$$ vertices.  Only node $$$2$$$ has an apple left. Choose the apple path $$$(2, 2)$$$. This path only consists of the single node $$$2$$$. $$$d = 1$$$ as there is $$$1$$$ apple on this path. Append $$$1, 2, 2$$$ in that order to our sequence $$$a$$$ and remove the apple from $$$2$$$. The final sequence is thus $$$[3, 4, 3, 1, 2, 2]$$$. It can be shown this is the lexicographically largest sequence possible.
