C. Cherry Bombtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTwo integer arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of size $$$n$$$ are complementary if there exists an integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$a_i + b_i = x$$$ over all $$$1 \le i \le n$$$. For example, the arrays $$$a = [2, 1, 4]$$$ and $$$b = [3, 4, 1]$$$ are complementary, since $$$a_i + b_i = 5$$$ over all $$$1 \le i \le 3$$$. However, the arrays $$$a = [1, 3]$$$ and $$$b = [2, 1]$$$ are not complementary.Cow the Nerd thinks everybody is interested in math, so he gave Cherry Bomb two integer arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. It is known that $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ both contain $$$n$$$ non-negative integers not greater than $$$k$$$. Unfortunately, Cherry Bomb has lost some elements in $$$b$$$. Lost elements in $$$b$$$ are denoted with $$$-1$$$. Help Cherry Bomb count the number of possible arrays $$$b$$$ such that:  $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are complementary.  All lost elements are replaced with non-negative integers no more than $$$k$$$. InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \le k \le 10^9$$$) — the size of the arrays and the maximum possible value of their elements.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le k$$$).The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$$$ ($$$-1 \le b_i \le k$$$). If $$$b_i = -1$$$, then this element is missing.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputOutput exactly one integer, the number of ways Cherry Bomb can fill in the missing elements from $$$b$$$ such that $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are complementary.ExampleInput73 101 3 2-1 -1 15 10 1 0 0 1-1 0 1 0 -15 10 1 0 0 1-1 1 -1 1 -15 101 3 2 5 4-1 -1 -1 -1 -15 41 3 2 1 31 -1 -1 1 -15 41 3 2 1 32 -1 -1 2 05 55 0 5 4 35 -1 -1 -1 -1Output1

NoteIn the first example, the only way to fill in the missing elements in $$$b$$$ such that $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are complementary is if $$$b = [2, 0, 1]$$$.In the second example, there is no way to fill in the missing elements of $$$b$$$ such that $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are complementary.In the fourth example, some $$$b$$$ arrays that are complementary to $$$a$$$ are: $$$[4, 2, 3, 0, 1], [7, 5, 6, 3, 4],$$$ and $$$[9, 7, 8, 5, 6]$$$.
