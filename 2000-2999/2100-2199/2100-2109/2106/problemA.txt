A. Dr. TCtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn order to test his patients' intelligence, Dr. TC created the following test.First, he creates a binary string$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$s$$$ having $$$n$$$ characters. Then, he creates $$$n$$$ binary strings $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. It is known that $$$a_i$$$ is created by first copying $$$s$$$, then flipping the $$$i$$$'th character ($$$\texttt{1}$$$ becomes $$$\texttt{0}$$$ and vice versa). After creating all $$$n$$$ strings, he arranges them into a grid where the $$$i$$$'th row is $$$a_i$$$. For example,   If $$$s = \texttt{101}$$$, $$$a = [\texttt{001}, \texttt{111}, \texttt{100}]$$$.  If $$$s = \texttt{0000}$$$, $$$a = [\texttt{1000}, \texttt{0100}, \texttt{0010}, \texttt{0001}]$$$. The patient needs to count the number of $$$1$$$s written on the board in less than a second. Can you pass the test?$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A binary string is a string that only consists of characters $$$\texttt{1}$$$ and $$$\texttt{0}$$$.InputThe first line of the input consists of a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10$$$) — the length of the binary string $$$s$$$.The second line of each test case contains a single binary string $$$s$$$ of size $$$n$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer, the number of $$$\texttt{1}$$$s on the board.ExampleInput53101115000002113010Output5

NoteThe first example is explained in the statement.For the second example, the only string written on the board will be the string $$$\texttt{0}$$$; therefore, the answer is $$$0$$$.In the third example, the following strings will be written on the board: $$$[\texttt{10000}, \texttt{01000}, \texttt{00100}, \texttt{00010}, \texttt{00001}]$$$; so there are five $$$\texttt{1}$$$s written on the board.
