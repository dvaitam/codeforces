Note that the grid must have at least two cells; otherwise, the game has already ended.  After that, in the same turn, Fouad moves his monster to any cell (possibly the same one it was in) within the remaining grid.     Visualization of the phases of the fourth test case. Mouf wants to minimize the number of turns, while Fouad wants to maximize them. How many turns will this epic duel last if both play optimally?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$a$$$, and $$$b$$$ ($$$2 \le n, m \le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \le a \le n$$$, $$$1 \le b \le m$$$) — denoting the number of rows, the number of columns, the starting row of the monster, and the starting column of the monster, respectively.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of turns this epic duel will last if both play optimally.ExampleInput82 2 1 13 3 2 22 7 1 42 7 2 28 9 4 69 9 5 52 20 2 1122 99 20 70Output2

NoteIn the first test case, one possible duel sequence is as follows:  Turn 1: Mouf cuts the grid horizontally along the line between the rows $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, removing the bottom half and leaving a $$$1 \times 2$$$ grid.  Turn 1: Fouad's monster is at the cell $$$(1,1)$$$.  Turn 2: Mouf cuts the $$$1 \times 2$$$ grid again, removes one column, and isolates the cell $$$(1,1)$$$. The duel is completed in $$$2$$$ turns.In the fourth case, one possible duel sequence is as follows:  Turn 1: Mouf cuts the grid vertically along the line between the columns $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, splitting it into a $$$2 \times 2$$$ and a $$$2 \times 5$$$ field, then removes the $$$2 \times 5$$$ part.  Turn 1: Fouad moves the monster to the cell $$$(1,1)$$$.  From this point on, the duel plays out just like the first test case—two more turns trim down the grid from $$$2 \times 2$$$ to a single $$$1 \times 1$$$ cell. In total, the duel is completed in $$$3$$$ turns.You can refer to the pictures mentioned in the problem statement for illustrations of the fourth test case.
