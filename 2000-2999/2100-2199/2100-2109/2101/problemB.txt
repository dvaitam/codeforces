B. Quartet Swappingtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard output   You are given a permutation $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$. You are allowed to do the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):  Choose an index $$$1\le i\le n - 3$$$. Then, swap $$$a_i$$$ with $$$a_{i + 2}$$$, and $$$a_{i + 1}$$$ with $$$a_{i + 3}$$$ simultaneously. In other words, permutation $$$a$$$ will be transformed from $$$[\ldots, a_i, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, a_{i+3}, \ldots]$$$ to $$$[\ldots, a_{i+2}, a_{i+3}, a_{i}, a_{i+1}, \ldots]$$$. Determine the lexicographically smallest permutation$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ that can be obtained by applying the above operation any number of times.$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array). $$$^{\text{†}}$$$An array $$$x$$$ is lexicographically smaller than an array $$$y$$$ of the same size if and only if the following holds:   in the first position where $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ differ, the array $$$x$$$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $$$y$$$.  InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of permutation $$$a$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le n$$$) — the elements of permutation $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$. OutputFor each test case, output the lexicographically smallest permutation that can be obtained by applying the above operation any number of times.ExampleInput343 4 1 255 4 3 1 21010 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1Output1 2 3 4

NoteIn the first test case, an operation can be done on index $$$i = 1$$$, and the permutation will become $$$[1, 2, 3, 4]$$$, which is the lexicographically smallest permutation achievable.In the second test case, we can do the following sequence of operations:  Do an operation on index $$$i = 2$$$. The permutation becomes $$$[5, 1, 2, 4, 3]$$$.  Do an operation on index $$$i = 1$$$. The permutation becomes $$$[2, 4, 5, 1, 3]$$$.  Do an operation on index $$$i = 2$$$. The permutation becomes $$$[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]$$$.
