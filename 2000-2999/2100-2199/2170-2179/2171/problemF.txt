A. ASCII Art Contesttime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThree leading AI-powered creative assistants—Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude—enter the first ever ASCII Art Contest, where they must impress a panel of human judges with their text-based masterpieces.Each participant receives a score between 80 and 100 (inclusive). The organizers want to announce the final standing only if the judges' opinions are "close enough"; otherwise, they will ask the judges to reconsider.Given the three integer scores of Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude, determine the contest result:  If the maximum score and the minimum score differ by at least 10 points, print check again (the judging seems inconsistent, so the panel must re-evaluate).  Otherwise, print final X, where X is the median of the three scores (the score that would be in the middle if all three were sorted in non-decreasing order). InputA single line contains three integers $$$g, c, \ell$$$, representing the scores of Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude respectively.  $$$80\le g, c, \ell \le 100$$$ OutputPrint the required answer in a line.ExamplesInput88 94 95
