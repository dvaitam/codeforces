It can be proved that this is always possible.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 20$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\le n\le 100$$$) — the length of the string.The following line contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$100$$$. OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations needed to make every character the same.ExampleInput53qwq2aa4test5abbac6abcabcOutput10244NoteIn the first test case, you can change $$$s_2$$$ to $$$s_3$$$ using $$$1$$$ operation to reach the goal.In the third test case, you can change $$$s_3$$$ to $$$s_4$$$ and then change $$$s_2$$$ to $$$s_3$$$, using $$$2$$$ operations in total. It can be proved that the answer is not less than $$$2$$$.
