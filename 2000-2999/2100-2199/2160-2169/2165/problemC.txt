Binary Winetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard output  You are given $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ within the range $$$[0,2^{30})$$$.You can spend $$$1$$$ coin to increase any $$$a_i$$$ by $$$1$$$. You can perform this operation any number of times.You need to solve $$$q$$$ queries; for each query, you are given an integer $$$c$$$, also in the range $$$[0,2^{30})$$$. You would like it if there exists a sequence $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$ with the following properties:   For every $$$1\le i\le n$$$, $$$0\le b_i\le a_i$$$.  $$$b_1\oplus b_2\oplus\ldots\oplus b_n=c$$$, where $$$\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.  Please calculate the minimum number of coins you will have to spend, such that there exists a suitable $$$b$$$.The queries are independent, meaning that any operations you perform on the sequence $$$a$$$ will not impact future queries.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case consists of two integers $$$n,q$$$ ($$$1\le n\le5\cdot10^5$$$, $$$1\le q\le5\cdot10^4$$$) — the length of sequence $$$a$$$ and the number of queries.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$0\le a_i<2^{30}$$$) — the initial sequence $$$a$$$.Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains a single integer $$$c$$$ ($$$0\le c<2^{30}$$$) — the target XOR.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5\cdot10^5$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5\cdot10^4$$$. OutputFor each query, output a single integer — the minimum coins you will have to spend, such that there exists a suitable $$$b$$$.ExampleInput42 15 793 19 9 8246 41 1 4 5 1 4102030401 100Output1731116310NoteIn the first test case, we spend $$$1$$$ coin to increase $$$a_2$$$ by $$$1$$$, resulting in sequence $$$[5,8]$$$. A suitable $$$b$$$ would be $$$[1,8]$$$. It can be shown one cannot spend less than $$$1$$$ coin to achieve the objective.In the second test case, we can spend $$$7$$$ coins to increase $$$a_1$$$ by $$$7$$$, resulting in sequence $$$[16,9,8]$$$. A suitable $$$b$$$ would be $$$[16,9,1]$$$.
