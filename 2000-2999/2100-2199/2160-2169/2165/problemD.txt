Path Splittime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard output  You are given a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$.You would like to partition $$$a$$$ into several subsequences$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k$$$, satisfying the following conditions:  Each element in $$$a$$$ belongs to exactly one of $$$b_i$$$.  For each sequence $$$b_i$$$, let its elements be $$$b_{i,1},b_{i,2},\ldots,b_{i,p_i}$$$. For every $$$1\le j<p_i$$$, $$$|b_{i,j}-b_{i,j+1}|=1$$$ should hold. Please calculate the minimum number of subsequences you can partition $$$a$$$ into.$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A sequence $$$b_i$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$a$$$ if $$$b_i$$$ can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions. InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n\le10^6$$$) — the length of the sequence $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\le a_i\le2n$$$) — the sequence $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$. OutputFor each test case, print a single integer on one line — the minimum number of subsequences $$$a$$$ can be partitioned into.ExampleInput71112811 13 10 11 11 11 13 1068 8 6 7 7 735 1 31011 14 14 13 12 14 12 10 14 1212Output1153371NoteIn the first test case, we can partition $$$a$$$ into subsequences $$$[1]$$$. It is obvious that we cannot partition $$$a$$$ into fewer subsequences; thus, $$$1$$$ is the answer.In the third test case, we can partition $$$a$$$ into subsequences $$$[11,10,11,10],[13],[11],[11],[13]$$$. Please note that $$$[11,10,11,11,11,10]$$$ is not a valid sequence, since $$$|11-11|=0\neq1$$$.
