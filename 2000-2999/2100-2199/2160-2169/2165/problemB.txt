You would like to generate a new multiset $$$s$$$ through the following procedure:  Partition $$$a$$$ into any number of non-empty multisets $$$x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_k$$$, such that each element of $$$a$$$ belongs to exactly one of these multisets.  Initially, $$$s$$$ is empty. From each $$$x_i$$$, choose one of its modes$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ and insert it into $$$s$$$. Please count the number of different multisets $$$s$$$ that can be generated through the procedure, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.Please note that the number of different multisets is counted, which means that the order of elements does not matter. However, the count of each element does matter, i.e. $$$\{1,1,2\},\{1,2\},\{1,1,2,2\}$$$ are all considered different.$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$The mode of a multiset is defined as the element which appears the most; if several elements are tied as the maximum, then all of them are considered modes.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 5000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n\le5000$$$) — the size of multiset $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\le a_i\le n$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$. OutputFor each test case, print one line containing a single integer — the number of different multisets you can obtain, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.ExampleInput531 2 331 1 131 2 2101 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 4101 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4Output734111126NoteIn the first test case, any non-empty subset of $$$\{1,2,3\}$$$ can be achieved, for a total of $$$7$$$ multisets.In the third test case, we can generate $$$4$$$ different multisets:  Partition the elements into set $$$\{1,2,2\}$$$, resulting in multiset $$$\{2\}$$$.  Partition the elements into sets $$$\{1,2\},\{2\}$$$, resulting in multiset $$$\{2,2\}$$$.  Partition the elements into sets $$$\{1\},\{2,2\}$$$, resulting in multiset $$$\{1,2\}$$$.  Partition the elements into sets $$$\{1\},\{2\},\{2\}$$$, resulting in multiset $$$\{1,2,2\}$$$. It can be proven that no other multisets are possible.
