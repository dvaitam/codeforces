E. khba Loves to Sleep!time limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputkhba has $$$n$$$ friends, each standing on a line at position $$$a_i$$$, and each of them is in the range $$$[0, x]$$$.They all want to come to him. One of his friends, Isamatdin, gave him $$$k$$$ teleports. Each friend will walk to the nearest teleport (choosing the shortest distance). Once a friend reaches a teleport, khba and the friend can instantly meet.But khba is so tired that he'll be sleeping while his friends are walking toward him. Now he wants to choose $$$k$$$ teleport positions so that their positions are distinct and lie within the range $$$[0, x]$$$, in order to maximize the time it takes for the first friend who reaches a teleport to reach it. Assume that friends move at the same speed. Since khba isn't good at calculations, you should output the $$$k$$$ chosen teleport positions.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$, and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \leq n, k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$k - 1 \leq x \leq 10^9$$$) — the number of friends, the number of teleports, and the range of possible positions for the teleports.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_i \leq x$$$) — the positions of khba's friends.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single line containing $$$k$$$ integers — the $$$k$$$ chosen teleport positions. The positions must be distinct and lie within the range $$$[0, x]$$$. The positions may be output in any order.If there are multiple optimal choices, output any of them.ExampleInput104 1 41 0 2 45 5 40 1 2 3 42 1 44 03 4 62 4 33 2 126 12 04 3 128 12 0 41 1 100000000001 1 100000000010000000003 4 98 7 93 4 92 0 1Output3

Nearest teleport for each friend is in $$$3$$$, minimal times for friends are $$$[2, 3, 1, 1]$$$, respectively. Sample 2. Friends at positions $$$[0,1,2,3,4]$$$. Chosen teleport positions: $$$[0,1,2,3,4]$$$. Minimal times for friends are $$$[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$$$, respectively.Sample 3. Friends at positions $$$[4,0]$$$. Chosen teleport position: $$$[2]$$$.Minimal times for friends are $$$[2, 2]$$$, respectively.Sample 4. Friends at positions $$$[2,4,3]$$$. Chosen teleport positions: $$$[0,1,5,6]$$$. Minimal times for friends are $$$[1, 1, 2]$$$, respectively. Sample 5. Friends at positions $$$[6,12,0]$$$. Chosen teleport positions: $$$[3,9]$$$. Minimal times for friends are $$$[3, 3, 3]$$$, respectively.
