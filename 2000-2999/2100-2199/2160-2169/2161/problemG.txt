G. Bitwise And Equalstime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$, and there is an integer $$$X$$$. You may perform the following operation zero or more times:  Select $$$i$$$, and increase $$$a_i$$$ by one. Let $$$a'$$$ be the final state of the array. Your goal is to perform the operation above the smallest number of times such that $$$a'_1 \,\&\, a'_2 \,\&\, \ldots \,\&\, a'_n = X$$$. $$$\&$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation. There are $$$q$$$ such query integers $$$X$$$: $$$X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_q$$$. Compute the answer for each $$$X = X_i$$$. Note that all queries are processed separately and independently, from the same initial state $$$a$$$.InputThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 200\,000$$$, $$$1 \le q \le 200\,000$$$) — the length of the array and the number of queries.The second line contains integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ (for each $$$i$$$, $$$0 \le a_i < 2^{20}$$$).The next $$$q$$$ lines each contain a single integer $$$X_i$$$ ($$$0 \le X_i < 2^{20}$$$).OutputFor each query $$$i$$$ out of $$$q$$$, print the smallest number of operations to get to the array $$$a'$$$ such that $$$a'_1 \,\&\, a'_2 \,\&\, \ldots \,\&\, a'_n = X_i$$$.It's possible to show, that it's always possible to obtain such array $$$a'$$$ in finite number of operations.ExampleInput5 46 4 7 5 40246Output1

NoteFor the first query, you can increase $$$i = 3$$$ ($$$a_i = 7$$$) and get the array $$$a = [6, 4, 8, 5, 4]$$$, then $$$6 \,\&\, 4 \,\&\, 8 \,\&\, 5 \,\&\, 4 = 0$$$.For the third query, original array already matches condition: $$$6 \,\&\, 4 \,\&\, 7 \,\&\, 5 \,\&\, 4 = 4$$$.
