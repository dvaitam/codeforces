Vasya made a bet with Petya that he will take part in more rated rounds than him. Initially, Vasya's rating is $$$R_0$$$. There will be $$$n$$$ rounds conducted in total, each of one of two types:   div. 1 — rated for all participants  div. 2 — rated for participants with rating strictly less than $$$X$$$, and unrated for all others,  In an unrated round, Vasya cannot change his rating. If Vasya's rating before a rated round was $$$R$$$, then for any non-negative integer $$$x$$$ between $$$R-D$$$ and $$$R+D$$$ (inclusive) Vasya can adopt a strategy such that his rating becomes exactly $$$x$$$ afterwards (here $$$D$$$ is a positive integer). Note that rating may never become negative.Help Vasya determine the maximum number of rated rounds he can participate in.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains four integers: $$$R_0, X, D, n$$$ ($$$0 \leq R_0 \leq 10^9$$$, $$$1 \leq X \leq 10^9$$$, $$$1 \leq D, n \leq 1000$$$) — Vasya's initial rating, the rating threshold between divisions, the maximum rating delta, and the number of rounds.The second line of each test case contains a string of size $$$n$$$. The string will only contain the characters "1" and "2", representing div. 1 and div. 2 rounds respectively.The sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^4$$$.OutputFor each test case, print a single integer — the maximum number of rated rounds Vasya can participate in.ExampleInput42100 2100 5 32222098 2100 5 61112112115 2100 226 722111210 10 4 822111121Output0658NoteIn the first example, since $$$R_0 \geq X$$$, each div. 2 round is unrated for Vasya, so his rating never changes. Therefore, he cannot make any round rated for himself, and the answer is $$$0$$$.In the second example, one of the optimal sequences of ratings after each round is: $$$2098 \rightarrow 2103 \rightarrow 2101 \rightarrow 2099 \rightarrow 2097 \rightarrow 2097 \rightarrow 2092$$$.
