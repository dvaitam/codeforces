C. Beautiful XORtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. You are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):   choose any integer $$$x$$$ such that $$$0 \le x \le a$$$ (the current value of $$$a$$$, not initial),  set $$$a := a \oplus x$$$. Here, $$$\oplus$$$ represents the bitwise XOR operator. After performing a sequence of operations, you want the value of $$$a$$$ to become exactly $$$b$$$.Find a sequence of at most $$$100$$$ operations (values of $$$x$$$ used in each operation) that transforms $$$a$$$ into $$$b$$$, or report that it is impossible.Note that you are not required to find the minimum number of operations, but any valid sequence of at most $$$100$$$ operations.InputThe first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b \le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, if it is impossible to obtain $$$b$$$ from $$$a$$$ using the allowed operations, print a single line containing $$$-1$$$.Otherwise, on the first line print a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \le k \le 100$$$) — the number of operations. On the second line print $$$k$$$ integers ($$$x_1, x_2, \dots , x_k$$$) — the chosen values of $$$x$$$ in the order you apply them.If there are multiple valid sequences, you may print any one of them.ExampleInput69 613 13292 929405 400998 244244 353Output27 80-115225 779-1NoteFor the first test case,   choose $$$x = 7$$$, now $$$a$$$ becomes equal to $$$9 \oplus 7 = 14$$$.  choose $$$x = 8$$$, now $$$a$$$ becomes equal to $$$14 \oplus 8 = 6$$$.  Thus, we can make $$$a = b$$$.For the fourth test case, choosing $$$x = 5$$$ makes $$$a = b$$$.
