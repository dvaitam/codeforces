B. Beautiful Stringtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a binary$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$.Your task is to find any subsequence$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of $$$s$$$ such that:  The subsequence $$$p$$$ is non-decreasing. That is, each character in $$$p$$$ is not greater than the next one.  Let $$$x$$$ denote the string obtained by removing all characters of $$$p$$$ from $$$s$$$, while preserving the order of the remaining characters. Then $$$x$$$ must be a palindrome$$$^{\text{‡}}$$$. You only need to output any valid subsequence $$$p$$$ that satisfies both conditions. If no such subsequence exists, output $$$-1$$$.Note that an empty string is both non-decreasing and a palindrome.$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A binary string is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1'.$$$^{\text{†}}$$$A subsequence of a string $$$s = s_1s_2\ldots s_n$$$ is a sequence $$$p = s_{i_1}s_{i_2}\ldots s_{i_k}$$$ such that $$$1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_k \leq n$$$. The characters are selected in order, but not necessarily contiguously. Note that an empty string is a subsequence of any string. $$$^{\text{‡}}$$$A string $$$t = t_1t_2\ldots t_m$$$ is a palindrome if $$$t_i = t_{m - i + 1}$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq m$$$. In other words, the string reads the same forward and backward. InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 3000$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10$$$) — the length of the string.The second line contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$.OutputIf a solution exists:   On the first line, print a single integer $$$k$$$ ($$$0 \le k \le n$$$) — the length of the subsequence $$$p$$$.  On the second line, print $$$k$$$ distinct integers $$$i_1, i_2, \dots, i_k$$$ ($$$1 \le i_1 < i_2 < \dots < i_k \le n$$$) — the indices of the characters in $$$s$$$ that form $$$p$$$ (in order as they appear in $$$s$$$). Otherwise, print a single line containing $$$-1$$$.ExampleInput5301030015001118110100116100101Output022 351 2 3 4 523 425 6NoteIn the first test case, we remove an empty string, resulting in $$$x = \texttt{010}$$$, which is a palindrome.In the second test case, we remove $$$p = \texttt{01}$$$ (indices $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$), resulting in $$$x = \texttt{0}$$$, which is a palindrome.In the third test case, we remove $$$p = \texttt{00111}$$$ (indices $$$1$$$ to $$$5$$$), resulting in an empty string, which is trivially a palindrome.In the fourth test case, we remove $$$p = \texttt{01}$$$ (indices $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$), resulting in $$$x = \texttt{110011}$$$, which is a palindrome.In the fifth test case, we remove $$$p = \texttt{01}$$$ (indices $$$5$$$, $$$6$$$), resulting in $$$x = \texttt{1001}$$$, which is a palindrome.
