You also own a binary$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ string $$$s$$$ of size $$$n$$$ where $$$s_i = \mathtt{0}$$$ for all $$$1 \le i \le n$$$. You may do the following operation at most $$$5$$$ times:  Choose any two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that $$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$. Then, for every $$$i$$$ such that $$$l < i < r$$$ and $$$\min(p_l, p_r) < p_i < \max(p_l, p_r)$$$ hold at the same time, you will set $$$s_i$$$ to $$$\mathtt{1}$$$. You are also given a binary string $$$x$$$ of size $$$n$$$. After performing operations, it must hold for every $$$1 \le i \le n$$$ that if $$$x_i = \mathtt{1}$$$, then $$$s_i = \mathtt{1}$$$. Note that if $$$x_i = \mathtt{0}$$$, then $$$s_i$$$ can have any value.Figure out any sequence of at most $$$5$$$ operations such that the aforementioned condition is satisfied, or report that it is impossible to do so. Note that you do not have to minimize the number of operations you make.$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A permutation $$$p$$$ of every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ is a sequence of elements from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ such that every element appears exactly once.$$$^{\text{†}}$$$A string $$$b$$$ of size $$$m$$$ is considered binary if and only if $$$b_i = \mathtt{0}$$$ or $$$b_i = \mathtt{1}$$$ for all $$$1 \le i \le m$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of the array.The second line contains exactly $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le n$$$, the elements of $$$p$$$ are pairwise distinct) — where $$$p_i$$$ is the $$$i$$$-th element of the permutation.The third line contains a single binary string $$$x$$$ of size $$$n$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, if it is impossible to perform operations such that the constraint is satisfied, output $$$-1$$$. Otherwise, output an integer $$$0 \le k \le 5$$$, the number of operations. On the $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$k$$$ lines, output two integers $$$1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$$$, the bounds of the $$$i$$$-th operation that is performed. If there are multiple correct solutions, output any of them.ExampleInput631 2 301053 4 2 1 51111161 3 2 4 6 500110066 2 3 4 5 111011052 1 4 3 50000052 5 3 1 400100Output1

After the operation, we set $$$s_2$$$ to $$$\mathtt{1}$$$ since $$$l < 2 < r$$$ and $$$\min(p_l, p_r) < p_2 = 2 < \max(p_l, p_r)$$$ hold at the same time. As a result, $$$s = \mathtt{010}$$$.In the second example, it can be shown that there does not exist a correct sequence of at most $$$5$$$ operations, so we output $$$-1$$$.In the third example, $$$p = [1, 3, 2, 4, 6, 5]$$$ and $$$x = \mathtt{001100}$$$. After performing an operation for $$$l = 1$$$ and $$$r = 5$$$, then $$$s = \mathtt{011100}$$$. If we also perform an operation for $$$l = 2$$$ and $$$r = 6$$$, then $$$s$$$ will remain the same. The string $$$s = \mathtt{011100}$$$ is valid, because for every position where $$$x$$$ has a $$$\mathtt{1}$$$, then $$$s$$$ also has a $$$\mathtt{1}$$$ at that position.
