B. Even Modulo Pairtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard output You are given a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers $$$a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n$$$. Find two distinct elements $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ from the sequence such that $$$x < y$$$ and $$$y \bmod x$$$ is even, or determine that no such pair exists.$$$p \bmod q$$$ denotes the remainder from dividing $$$p$$$ by $$$q$$$. InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the length of the sequence.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\le a_1 < \ldots < a_n\le 10^9$$$) — the given sequence.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case:  If no such pair exists, output -1.  Otherwise, output two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ — the elements that satisfy the condition. If there are multiple valid pairs, you may output any of them.ExampleInput451 3 4 5 662 3 5 7 11 1342 3 13 37317 117 1117Output3 5

NoteVisualizer linkIn the first test case, choosing $$$x = 3$$$ and $$$y = 5$$$ yields $$$y \bmod x = 5 \bmod 3 = 2$$$, which is even.In the third test case, it is clear that no valid pair exists.
