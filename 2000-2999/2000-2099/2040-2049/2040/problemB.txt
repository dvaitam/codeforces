B. Paint a Striptime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou have an array of zeros $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$.You can perform two types of operations on it:   Choose an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \le i \le n$$$ and $$$a_i = 0$$$, and assign $$$1$$$ to $$$a_i$$$;  Choose a pair of indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that $$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$, $$$a_l = 1$$$, $$$a_r = 1$$$, $$$a_l + \ldots + a_r \ge \lceil\frac{r - l + 1}{2}\rceil$$$, and assign $$$1$$$ to $$$a_i$$$ for all $$$l \le i \le r$$$. What is the minimum number of operations of the first type needed to make all elements of the array equal to one?InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array.Note that there is no limit on the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases.OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of needed operations of first type.ExampleInput412420Output1

NoteIn the first test case, you can perform an operation of the $$$1$$$st type with $$$i = 1$$$.In the second test case, you can perform the following sequence of operations:  Operation of $$$1$$$st type, $$$i = 1$$$. After performing this operation, the array will look like this: $$$[1, 0]$$$.  Operation of $$$1$$$st type, $$$i = 2$$$. After performing this operation, the array will look like this: $$$[1, 1]$$$.  The sequence of operations in the second test case  In the third test case, you can perform the following sequence of operations:  Operation of $$$1$$$st type, $$$i = 1$$$. After performing this operation, the array will look like this: $$$[1, 0, 0, 0]$$$.  Operation of $$$1$$$st type, $$$i = 4$$$. After performing this operation, the array will look like this: $$$[1, 0, 0, 1]$$$.  Operation of $$$2$$$nd type, $$$l = 1$$$, $$$r = 4$$$. On this segment, $$$a_l + \ldots + a_r = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 2$$$, which is not less than $$$\lceil\frac{r - l + 1}{2}\rceil = 2$$$. After performing this operation, the array will look like this: $$$[1, 1, 1, 1]$$$.  The sequence of operations in the third test case
