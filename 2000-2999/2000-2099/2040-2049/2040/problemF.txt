Number of Cubestime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputConsider a rectangular parallelepiped with sides $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$, that consists of unit cubes of $$$k$$$ different colors. We can apply cyclic shifts to the parallelepiped in any of the three directions any number of times$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$.There are $$$d_i$$$ cubes of the $$$i$$$-th color ($$$1 \le i \le k$$$). How many different parallelepipeds (with the given sides) can be formed from these cubes, no two of which can be made equal by some combination of cyclic shifts?$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$On the image:   Top left shows the top view of the original parallelepiped. Lower layers will shift in the same way as the top layer.  Top right shows the top view of a parallelepiped shifted to the right by $$$1$$$.  Bottom left shows the top view of a parallelepiped shifted down by $$$2$$$.  Bottom right shows the top view of a parallelepiped shifted to the right by $$$1$$$ and down by $$$2$$$.    InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains four integers: $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$, and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b, c \le 3 \cdot 10^6$$$; $$$a \cdot b \cdot c \le 3 \cdot 10^6$$$; $$$1 \le k \le 10^6$$$) — three sides of the parallelepiped and the number of colors of unit cubes.The second line of each test case contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k$$$ ($$$1 \le d_1 \le d_2 \le \ldots \le d_k \le 3 \cdot 10^6$$$) — the elements of the array $$$d$$$: the number of cubes of a given color.It is guaranteed that in each test case the sum of the elements of the array $$$d$$$ is equal to $$$a \cdot b \cdot c$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10 ^ 6$$$.OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the number of different parallelepipeds modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.ExampleInput61 1 1 116 1 1 31 2 312 1 1 32 4 63 3 1 23 62 3 3 26 1272 60 96 417280 86400 120960 190080Output1

NoteIn the first test case, there is only one parallelepiped, which consists of one unit cube. Possible parallelepipeds in the second test case
