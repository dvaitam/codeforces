D. Non Prime Treetime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a tree with $$$n$$$ vertices.You need to construct an array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of unique integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$2 \cdot n$$$, and such that for each edge $$$u_i \leftrightarrow v_i$$$ of the tree, the value $$$|a_{u_i} - a_{v_i}|$$$ is not a prime number.Find any array that satisfies these conditions, or report that there is no such array.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.The next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contain the edges of the tree, one edge per line. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$$$; $$$u_i \neq v_i$$$), denoting the edge between the nodes $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$.It's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10 ^ 5$$$.OutputFor each test case, if an array that satisfies the conditions exists, print its elements $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. Otherwise, print $$$-1$$$.ExampleInput251 22 32 43 571 21 32 43 53 63 7Output2 10 1 6 5
