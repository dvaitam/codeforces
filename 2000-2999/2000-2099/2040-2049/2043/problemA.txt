A. Coin Transformationtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputInitially, you have a coin with value $$$n$$$. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):  transform one coin with value $$$x$$$, where $$$x$$$ is greater than $$$3$$$ ($$$x>3$$$), into two coins with value $$$\lfloor \frac{x}{4} \rfloor$$$. What is the maximum number of coins you can have after performing this operation any number of times?InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^{18}$$$).OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the maximum number of coins you can have after performing the operation any number of times.ExampleInput415161000000000000000000Output1

NoteIn the first example, you have a coin of value $$$1$$$, and you can't do anything with it. So, the answer is $$$1$$$.In the second example, you can transform a coin of value $$$5$$$ into two coins with value $$$1$$$.In the third example, you can transform a coin of value $$$16$$$ into two coins with value $$$4$$$. Each of the resulting coins can be transformed into two coins with value $$$1$$$.
