D. Problem about GCDtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputGiven three integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, and $$$G$$$, find two integers $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ ($$$l \le A \le B \le r$$$) such that their greatest common divisor (GCD) equals $$$G$$$ and the distance $$$|A - B|$$$ is maximized.If there are multiple such pairs, choose the one where $$$A$$$ is minimized. If no such pairs exist, output "-1 -1".InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. Then, $$$t$$$ test cases follow.Each test case consists of a single line containing three integers $$$l, r, G$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le 10^{18}$$$; $$$1 \le G \le 10^{18}$$$) — the range boundaries and the required GCD.OutputFor each test case, output two integers $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ — the solution to the problem, or "-1 -1" if no such pair exists.ExampleInput44 8 24 8 34 8 45 7 6Output4 6
