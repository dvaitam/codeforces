K. GCDDCGtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are playing the Greatest Common Divisor Deck-Building Card Game (GCDDCG). There are $$$N$$$ cards (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$N$$$). Card $$$i$$$ has the value of $$$A_i$$$, which is an integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$N$$$ (inclusive).The game consists of $$$N$$$ rounds (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$N$$$). Within each round, you need to build two non-empty decks, deck $$$1$$$ and deck $$$2$$$. A card cannot be inside both decks, and it is allowed to not use all $$$N$$$ cards. In round $$$i$$$, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the card values in each deck must equal $$$i$$$.Your creativity point during round $$$i$$$ is the product of $$$i$$$ and the number of ways to build two valid decks. Two ways are considered different if one of the decks contains different cards.Find the sum of creativity points across all $$$N$$$ rounds. Since the sum can be very large, calculate the sum modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.InputThe first line consists of an integer $$$N$$$ ($$$2 \leq N \leq 200\,000)$$$.The second line consists of $$$N$$$ integers $$$A_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq A_i \leq N$$$).OutputOutput a single integer representing the sum of creativity points across all $$$N$$$ rounds modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.ExamplesInput3

NoteExplanation for the sample input/output #1The creativity point during each of rounds $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ is $$$0$$$.During round $$$3$$$, there are $$$12$$$ ways to build both decks. Denote $$$B$$$ and $$$C$$$ as the set of card numbers within deck $$$1$$$ and deck $$$2$$$, respectively. The $$$12$$$ ways to build both decks are:  $$$B = \{ 1 \}, C = \{ 2 \}$$$;  $$$B = \{ 1 \}, C = \{ 3 \}$$$;  $$$B = \{ 1 \}, C = \{ 2, 3 \}$$$;  $$$B = \{ 2 \}, C = \{ 1 \}$$$;  $$$B = \{ 2 \}, C = \{ 3 \}$$$;  $$$B = \{ 2 \}, C = \{ 1, 3 \}$$$;  $$$B = \{ 3 \}, C = \{ 1 \}$$$;  $$$B = \{ 3 \}, C = \{ 2 \}$$$;  $$$B = \{ 3 \}, C = \{ 1, 2 \}$$$;  $$$B = \{ 1, 2 \}, C = \{ 3 \}$$$;  $$$B = \{ 2, 3 \}, C = \{ 1 \}$$$; and  $$$B = \{ 1, 3 \}, C = \{ 2 \}$$$. Explanation for the sample input/output #2For rounds $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$, there are $$$0$$$, $$$18$$$, $$$0$$$, and $$$2$$$ ways to build both decks, respectively.
