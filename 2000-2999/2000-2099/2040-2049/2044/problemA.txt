She wants to know how many ordered pairs of positive integers $$$(a,b)$$$ there are such that $$$a=n-b$$$. Since Cube is not very good at math, please help her!InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 99$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 100$$$).OutputFor each test case, output the number of ordered pairs $$$(a, b)$$$ on a new line.ExampleInput3246Output1

NoteIn the first test case, the only ordered pair that works is $$$(a,b)=(1,1)$$$. In the second test case, the three ordered pairs of $$$(a,b)$$$ that work are $$$(3,1), (2,2), (1,3)$$$.
