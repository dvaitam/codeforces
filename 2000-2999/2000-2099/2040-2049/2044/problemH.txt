A good pancake factory must be good at flattening things, so Swing is going to test his new equipment on 2D matrices.Swing is given an $$$n \times n$$$ matrix $$$M$$$ containing positive integers. He has $$$q$$$ queries to ask you. For each query, he gives you four integers $$$x_1$$$, $$$y_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$, $$$y_2$$$ and asks you to flatten the submatrix bounded by $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$ into an array $$$A$$$. Formally, $$$A = [M_{(x1,y1)}, M_{(x1,y1+1)}, \ldots, M_{(x1,y2)}, M_{(x1+1,y1)}, M_{(x1+1,y1+1)}, \ldots, M_{(x2,y2)}]$$$. The following image depicts the flattening of a submatrix bounded by the red dotted lines. The orange arrows denote the direction that the elements of the submatrix are appended to the back of $$$A$$$, and $$$A$$$ is shown at the bottom of the image.     Afterwards, he asks you for the value of $$$\sum_{i=1}^{|A|} A_i \cdot i$$$ (sum of $$$A_i \cdot i$$$ over all $$$i$$$).InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2000, 1 \leq q \leq 10^6$$$) — the length of $$$M$$$ and the number of queries.The following $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$n$$$ integers each, the $$$i$$$'th of which contains $$$M_{(i,1)}, M_{(i,2)}, \ldots, M_{(i,n)}$$$ ($$$1 \leq M_{(i, j)} \leq 10^6$$$).The following $$$q$$$ lines contain four integers $$$x_1$$$, $$$y_1$$$, $$$x_2$$$, and $$$y_2$$$ ($$$1 \leq x_1 \leq x_2 \leq n, 1 \leq y_1 \leq y_2 \leq n$$$) — the bounds of the query.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2000$$$ and the sum of $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the results of the $$$q$$$ queries on a new line.ExampleInput24 31 5 2 44 9 5 34 5 2 31 5 5 21 1 4 42 2 3 31 2 4 33 31 2 34 5 67 8 91 1 1 31 3 3 32 2 2 2Output500 42 168

NoteIn the second query of the first test case, $$$A = [9, 5, 5, 2]$$$. Therefore, the sum is $$$1 \cdot 9 + 2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 5 + 4 \cdot 2 = 42$$$.
