C. Asuna and the Mosquitoestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFor her birthday, each of Asuna's $$$n$$$ admirers gifted her a tower. The height of the tower from the $$$i$$$-th admirer is equal to $$$a_i$$$. Asuna evaluates the beauty of the received gifts as $$$\max(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$$$. She can perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).   Take such $$$1 \le i \neq j \le n$$$ that $$$a_i + a_j$$$ is odd and $$$a_i > 0$$$, then decrease $$$a_i$$$ by $$$1$$$ and increase $$$a_j$$$ by $$$1$$$.  It is easy to see that the heights of the towers remain non-negative during the operations. Help Asuna find the maximum possible beauty of the gifts after any number of operations!InputEach test consists of several test cases. The first line of the input data contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of admirers of Asuna.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \ (1 \le a_i \le 10^9)$$$ — the heights of the towers.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer: the maximum value of the beauty of the gifts that Asuna can achieve.ExampleInput435 3 923 241 2 2 155 4 3 2 9Output9

NoteIn the first test case, no pair of towers satisfies the required condition for applying the operation, so no operations can be performed. In this case, the answer is $$$\max(5, \ 3, \ 9) = 9$$$.In the second test case, the operation with $$$i = 2$$$ and $$$j = 1$$$ can be applied twice. After that, the array becomes: $$$a \ = \ [5, \ 0]$$$. Thus, the answer is 5.In the third test case, the following sequence of operations can be applied: Operation with $$$i=1$$$ and $$$j=2$$$.$$$[1, \ 2, \ 2, \ 1] \quad \rightarrow \quad [0, \ 3, \ 2, \ 1]$$$ Operation with $$$i=3$$$ and $$$j=2$$$.$$$[0, \ 3, \ 2, \ 1] \quad \rightarrow \quad [0, \ 4, \ 1, \ 1]$$$ Operation with $$$i=3$$$ and $$$j=2$$$.$$$[0, \ 4, \ 1, \ 1] \quad \rightarrow \quad [0, \ 5, \ 0, \ 1]$$$$$$\max(0, \ 5, \ 0, \ 1) \ = \ 5$$$.Therefore, the answer is 5.
