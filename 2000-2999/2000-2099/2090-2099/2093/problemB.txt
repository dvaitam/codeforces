B. Expensive Numbertime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe cost of a positive integer $$$n$$$ is defined as the result of dividing the number $$$n$$$ by the sum of its digits.For example, the cost of the number $$$104$$$ is $$$\frac{104}{1 + 0 + 4} = 20.8$$$, and the cost of the number $$$111$$$ is $$$\frac{111}{1 + 1 + 1} = 37$$$.You are given a positive integer $$$n$$$ that does not contain leading zeros. You can remove any number of digits from the number $$$n$$$ (including none) so that the remaining number contains at least one digit and is strictly greater than zero. The remaining digits cannot be rearranged. As a result, you may end up with a number that has leading zeros.For example, you are given the number $$$103554$$$. If you decide to remove the digits $$$1$$$, $$$4$$$, and one digit $$$5$$$, you will end up with the number $$$035$$$, whose cost is $$$\frac{035}{0 + 3 + 5} = 4.375$$$.What is the minimum number of digits you need to remove from the number so that its cost becomes the minimum possible?InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains a positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n < 10^{100}$$$) without leading zeros.OutputFor each test case, output one integer on a new line — the number of digits that need to be removed from the number so that its cost becomes minimal.ExampleInput4666137001020307Output2
