A hit on the left can be recorded as "L", and a hit on the right as "R".The strange forces that rule this world are fickle: sometimes, a blow sounds once, and sometimes it sounds twice. Therefore, a hit on the left drum could have sounded as either "L" or "LL", and a hit on the right drum could have sounded as either "R" or "RR".The sequence of hits made is recorded in the string $$$p$$$, and the sounds heard are in the string $$$s$$$. Given $$$p$$$ and $$$s$$$, determine whether it is true that the string $$$s$$$ could have been the result of the hits from the string $$$p$$$.For example, if $$$p=$$$"LR", then the result of the hits could be any of the strings "LR", "LRR", "LLR", and "LLRR", but the strings "LLLR" or "LRL" cannot.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) – the number of independent test cases.The first line of each test case contains the string $$$p$$$ ($$$1 \le |p| \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) consisting only of the characters "R" and "L", where $$$|p|$$$ denotes the length of the string $$$p$$$.The second line of each test case contains the string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le |p| \le |s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) consisting only of the characters "R" and "L".It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$|s|$$$ does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$ across all test cases.OutputFor each set of input data, output "YES" if $$$s$$$ can be the heard sound, and "NO" otherwise. You may output in any case.ExampleInput5RRRLRLRLRLRLRLLLRLLLLLRLLLLLRRLLLLRLRLRRLLLLRLRRLLRRRLOutputYES
