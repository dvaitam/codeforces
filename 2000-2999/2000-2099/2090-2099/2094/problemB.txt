On day $$$0$$$, he started a plague by giving an infection to the unfortunate residents of house $$$0$$$. Each succeeding day, the plague spreads to exactly one healthy household that is next to an infected household. It can be shown that each day the infected houses form a continuous segment.Let the segment starting at the $$$l$$$-th house and ending at the $$$r$$$-th house be denoted as $$$[l, r]$$$. You know that after $$$n$$$ days, the segment $$$[l, r]$$$ became infected. Find any such segment $$$[l', r']$$$ that could have been infected on the $$$m$$$-th day ($$$m \le n$$$).InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) – the number of independent test cases.The only line of each test case contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$, $$$l$$$, and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \leq m\leq n \leq 2000, -n \leq l \leq 0 \leq r \leq n, r-l=n$$$).OutputFor each test case, output two integers $$$l'$$$ and $$$r'$$$ on a new line. If there are multiple solutions, output any.ExampleInput44 2 -2 24 1 0 43 3 -1 29 8 -6 3Output-1 1

NoteIn the first test case, it is possible that on the $$$1$$$-st, $$$2$$$-nd, and $$$3$$$-rd days the interval of houses affected is $$$[-1,0]$$$, $$$[-1,1]$$$, $$$[-2,1]$$$. Therefore, $$$[-1,1]$$$ is a valid output.
