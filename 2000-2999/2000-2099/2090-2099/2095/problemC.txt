C. Would It Be Unrated?time limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIt's a disaster. During the last April fools round, Codeforces crashed and consequentially, the round was unrated. No one knows what happened to some of the poor authors afterwards. After careful investigation, the Codeforces team has found out the reason behind this catastrophe. Apparently, authors added too many tests as they forgot the pretests were equal to system tests.We don't want to repeat this unfortunate incident and cause this round to be unrated as well.
