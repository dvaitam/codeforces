A. Vadim's Collectiontime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWe call a phone number a beautiful if it is a string of $$$10$$$ digits, where the $$$i$$$-th digit from the left is at least $$$10 - i$$$. That is, the first digit must be at least $$$9$$$, the second at least $$$8$$$, $$$\ldots$$$, with the last digit being at least $$$0$$$.For example, 9988776655 is a beautiful phone number, while 9099999999 is not, since the second digit, which is $$$0$$$, is less than $$$8$$$.Vadim has a beautiful phone number. He wants to rearrange its digits in such a way that the result is the smallest possible beautiful phone number. Help Vadim solve this problem.Please note that the phone numbers are compared as integers.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains a single string $$$s$$$ of length $$$10$$$, consisting of digits. It is guaranteed that $$$s$$$ is a beautiful phone number.OutputFor each test case, output a single string of length $$$10$$$ — the smallest possible beautiful phone number that Vadim can obtain.ExampleInput49999999999998877665599887766509899999999Output9999999999

NoteIn the first test case, for the first phone number 9999999999, regardless of the rearrangement of digits, the same phone number is obtained.In the second test case, for the phone number 9988776655, it can be proven that 9876556789 is the smallest phone number that can be obtained by rearranging the digits.
