B. Find the Permutationtime limit per test1.5 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard output  You are given an undirected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices, labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. This graph encodes a hidden permutation$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$p$$$ of size $$$n$$$. The graph is constructed as follows:  For every pair of integers $$$1 \le i < j \le n$$$, an undirected edge is added between vertex $$$p_i$$$ and vertex $$$p_j$$$ if and only if $$$p_i < p_j$$$. Note that the edge is not added between vertices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, but between the vertices of their respective elements. Refer to the notes section for better understanding. Your task is to reconstruct and output the permutation $$$p$$$. It can be proven that permutation $$$p$$$ can be uniquely determined.$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array), and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array). InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 1000$$$).The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains a string of $$$n$$$ characters $$$g_{i, 1}g_{i, 2}\ldots g_{i, n}$$$ ($$$g_{i, j} = \mathtt{0}$$$ or $$$g_{i, j} = \mathtt{1}$$$) — the adjacency matrix. $$$g_{i, j} = \mathtt{1}$$$ if and only if there is an edge between vertex $$$i$$$ and vertex $$$j$$$.It is guaranteed that there exists a permutation $$$p$$$ which generates the given graph. It is also guaranteed that the graph is undirected and has no self-loops, meaning $$$g_{i, j} = g_{j, i}$$$ and $$$g_{i, i} = \mathtt{0}$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$. OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ representing the reconstructed permutation.ExampleInput310500101001011100100001111106000000000000000000000000000000000000Output1

NoteIn the first case $$$p = [1]$$$. Since there are no pairs $$$1 \le i < j \le n$$$, there are no edges in the graph.The graph in the second case is shown below. For example, when we choose $$$i = 3$$$ and $$$j = 4$$$, we add an edge between vertices $$$p_i = 1$$$ and $$$p_j = 3$$$, because $$$p_i < p_j$$$. However, when we choose $$$i = 2$$$ and $$$j = 3$$$, $$$p_i = 2$$$ and $$$p_j = 1$$$, so $$$p_i < p_j$$$ doesn't hold. Therefore, we don't add an edge between $$$2$$$ and $$$1$$$.In the third case, there are no edges in the graph, so there are no pairs of integers $$$1 \le i < j \le n$$$ such that $$$p_i < p_j$$$. Therefore, $$$p = [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]$$$.
