Your hand in mine as we explore, please take me to tomorrow's shore. — Faye Wong, As WishedCocoly has a string $$$t$$$ of length $$$m$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters, and he would like to split it into parts. He calls a pair of strings $$$(x, y)$$$ beautiful if and only if there exists a sequence of strings $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$$$, such that:  $$$t = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_k$$$, where $$$+$$$ denotes string concatenation.  For each $$$1 \leq i \leq k$$$, at least one of the following holds: $$$a_i = x$$$, or $$$a_i = y$$$. Cocoly has another string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters. Now, for each $$$1 \leq i < n$$$, Cocoly wants you to determine whether the pair of strings $$$(s_1s_2 \ldots s_i, \, s_{i+1}s_{i+2} \ldots s_n)$$$ is beautiful.Note: since the input and output are large, you may need to optimize them for this problem.For example, in C++, it is enough to use the following lines at the start of the main() function:int main() {    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);    std::cin.tie(nullptr); std::cout.tie(nullptr);}InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \leq T \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq m \leq 5 \cdot 10^6$$$) — the lengths of $$$s$$$ and the length of $$$t$$$.The second line of each test case contains a single string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only of lowercase English letters.The third line of each test case contains a single string $$$t$$$ of length $$$m$$$, consisting only of lowercase English letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^7$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single binary string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n - 1$$$: for each $$$1 \leq i < n$$$, if the $$$i$$$-th pair is beautiful, $$$r_i=\texttt{1}$$$; otherwise, $$$r_i=\texttt{0}$$$. Do not output spaces.ExampleInput73 5abaababa4 10czzzczzzzzczzz5 14dreamdredreamamamam5 18tcccctcctccccctccctcccc7 11abababcabababababc7 26aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa19 29bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbOutput11

NoteIn the first test case, $$$s = \tt aba$$$, $$$t = \tt ababa$$$.  For $$$i = 1$$$: Cocoly can split $$$t = \texttt{a} + \texttt{ba} + \texttt{ba}$$$, so the string pair $$$(\texttt{a}, \texttt{ba})$$$ is beautiful.  For $$$i = 2$$$: Cocoly can split $$$t = \texttt{ab} + \texttt{ab} + \texttt{a}$$$, so the string pair $$$(\texttt{ab}, \texttt{a})$$$ is beautiful. In the second test case, $$$s = \tt czzz$$$, $$$t = \tt czzzzzczzz$$$.  For $$$i = 1$$$: It can be proven that there is no solution to give a partition of $$$t$$$ using strings $$$\texttt{c}$$$ and $$$\texttt{zzz}$$$.  For $$$i = 2$$$: Cocoly can split $$$t$$$ into $$$\texttt{cz} + \texttt{zz} + \texttt{zz} + \texttt{cz} + \texttt{zz}$$$.  For $$$i = 3$$$: Cocoly can split $$$t$$$ into $$$\texttt{czz} + \texttt{z} + \texttt{z} + \texttt{z} + \texttt{czz} + \texttt{z}$$$.
