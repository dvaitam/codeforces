C. Trip to the Olympiadtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputIn the upcoming year, there will be many team olympiads, so the teachers of "T-generation" need to assemble a team of three pupils to participate in them. Any three pupils will show a worthy result in any team olympiad. But winning the olympiad is only half the battle; first, you need to get there...Each pupil has an independence level, expressed as an integer. In "T-generation", there is exactly one student with each independence levels from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$, inclusive. For a team of three pupils with independence levels $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$, the value of their team independence is equal to $$$(a \oplus b) + (b \oplus c) + (a \oplus c)$$$, where $$$\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. Your task is to choose any trio of students with the maximum possible team independence.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case set contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$0 \le l, r < 2^{30}$$$, $$$r - l > 1$$$) — the minimum and maximum independence levels of the students.OutputFor each test case set, output three pairwise distinct integers $$$a, b$$$, and $$$c$$$, such that $$$l \le a, b, c \le r$$$ and the value of the expression $$$(a \oplus b) + (b \oplus c) + (a \oplus c)$$$ is maximized. If there are multiple triples with the maximum value, any of them can be output.ExampleInput80 20 81 36 22128 13769 98115 1270 1073741823Output1 2 0

NoteIn the first test case, the only suitable triplet of numbers ($$$a, b, c$$$) (up to permutation) is ($$$0, 1, 2$$$).In the second test case, one of the suitable triplets is ($$$8, 7, 1$$$), where $$$(8 \oplus 7) + (7 \oplus 1) + (8 \oplus 1) = 15 + 6 + 9 = 30$$$. It can be shown that $$$30$$$ is the maximum possible value of $$$(a \oplus b) + (b \oplus c) + (a \oplus c)$$$ for $$$0 \le a, b, c \le 8$$$.
