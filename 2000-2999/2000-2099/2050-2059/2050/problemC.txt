C. Uninteresting Numbertime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a number $$$n$$$ with a length of no more than $$$10^5$$$.You can perform the following operation any number of times: choose one of its digits, square it, and replace the original digit with the result. The result must be a digit (that is, if you choose the digit $$$x$$$, then the value of $$$x^2$$$ must be less than $$$10$$$).Is it possible to obtain a number that is divisible by $$$9$$$ through these operations?InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains the number $$$n$$$, without leading zeros. The length of the number does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of the lengths of the numbers across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to obtain a number divisible by $$$9$$$ using the described operations, and "NO" otherwise.You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive answer.ExampleInput9123322333333333333999754727789127731234567890233352254522632OutputNO

NoteIn the first example, from the integer $$$123$$$, it is possible to obtain only $$$123$$$, $$$143$$$, $$$129$$$, and $$$149$$$, none of which are divisible by $$$9$$$.In the second example, you need to replace the second digit with its square; then $$$n$$$ will equal $$$342 = 38 \cdot 9$$$.In the third example, the integer is already divisible by $$$9$$$.
