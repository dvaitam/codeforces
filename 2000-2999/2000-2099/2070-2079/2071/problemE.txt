E. LeaFalltime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard output   You are given a tree$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ with $$$n$$$ vertices. Over time, each vertex $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$) has a probability of $$$\frac{p_i}{q_i}$$$ of falling. Determine the expected value of the number of unordered pairs$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of distinct vertices that become leaves$$$^{\text{‡}}$$$ in the resulting forest$$$^{\text{§}}$$$, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.Note that when vertex $$$v$$$ falls, it is removed along with all edges connected to it. However, adjacent vertices remain unaffected by the fall of $$$v$$$.$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A tree is a connected graph without cycles. $$$^{\text{†}}$$$An unordered pair is a collection of two elements where the order in which the elements appear does not matter. For example, the unordered pair $$$(1, 2)$$$ is considered the same as $$$(2, 1)$$$.$$$^{\text{‡}}$$$A leaf is a vertex that is connected to exactly one edge.$$$^{\text{§}}$$$A forest is a graph without cyclesInputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$).The $$$i$$$-th line of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$p_i$$$ and $$$q_i$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i < q_i < 998\,244\,353$$$).Each of the following $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le u, v \le n$$$, $$$u \neq v$$$) — the indices of the vertices connected by an edge.It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$. OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the expected value of the number of unordered pairs of distinct vertices that become leaves in the resulting forest modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.Formally, let $$$M = 998\,244\,353$$$. It can be shown that the exact answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\frac{p}{q}$$$, where $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ are integers and $$$q \not \equiv 0 \pmod{M}$$$. Output the integer equal to $$$p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod M$$$. In other words, output such an integer $$$x$$$ that $$$0 \le x < M$$$ and $$$x \cdot q \equiv p \pmod{M}$$$.

NoteIn the first test case, only one vertex is in the tree, which is not a leaf, so the answer is $$$0$$$.In the second test case, the tree is shown below.     Vertices that have not fallen are denoted in bold. Let us examine the following three cases:     We arrive at this configuration with a probability of $$$\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) ^3$$$, where the only unordered pair of distinct leaf vertices is $$$(2, 3)$$$.      We arrive at this configuration with a probability of $$$\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) ^3$$$, where the only unordered pair of distinct leaf vertices is $$$(2, 1)$$$.      We arrive at this configuration with a probability of $$$\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) ^3$$$, where the only unordered pair of distinct leaf vertices is $$$(1, 3)$$$.   All remaining cases contain no unordered pairs of distinct leaf vertices. Hence, the answer is $$$\frac{1 + 1 + 1}{8} = \frac{3}{8}$$$, which is equal to $$$623\,902\,721$$$ modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.
