C. XOR and Triangletime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis time, the pink soldiers have given you an integer $$$x$$$ ($$$x \ge 2$$$).Please determine if there exists a positive integer $$$y$$$ that satisfies the following conditions.  $$$y$$$ is strictly less than $$$x$$$.  There exists a non-degenerate triangle$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ with side lengths $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, $$$x \oplus y$$$. Here, $$$\oplus$$$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. Additionally, if there exists such an integer $$$y$$$, output any.$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A triangle with side lengths $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ is non-degenerate when $$$a+b > c$$$, $$$a+c > b$$$, $$$b+c > a$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2000$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$2 \le x \le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print one integer on a separate line. The integer you must output is as follows:  If there exists an integer $$$y$$$ satisfying the conditions, output the value of $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \le y < x$$$);  Otherwise, output $$$-1$$$. If there exist multiple integers that satisfy the conditions, you may output any.ExampleInput75263694420Output3

NoteIn the first test case, there exists a non-degenerate triangle with side lengths $$$3$$$, $$$5$$$, and $$$3 \oplus 5 = 6$$$. Therefore, $$$y=3$$$ is a valid answer.In the second test case, $$$1$$$ is the only possible candidate for $$$y$$$, but it cannot make a non-degenerate triangle. Therefore, the answer is $$$-1$$$.
