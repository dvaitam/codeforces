Goodbye, Banker Lifetime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMonsters are approaching the city, and to protect it, Akito must create a protective field around the city. As everyone knows, protective fields come in various levels. Akito has chosen the field of level $$$n$$$. To construct the field, a special phrase is required, which is the $$$n$$$-th row of the Great Magical Triangle, represented as a two-dimensional array. We will call this array $$$T$$$.The triangle is defined as follows:   In the $$$i$$$-th row, there are $$$i$$$ integers.  The single integer in the first row is $$$k$$$.  Let the $$$j$$$-th element of the $$$i$$$-th row be denoted as $$$T_{i,j}$$$. Then $$$$$$T_{i,j} = \begin{cases} T_{i-1,j-1} \oplus T_{i-1,j}, &\textrm{if } 1 < j < i \\ T_{i-1,j}, &\textrm{if } j = 1 \\ T_{i-1,j-1}, &\textrm{if } j = i \end{cases}$$$$$$  where $$$a \oplus b$$$ is the bitwise exclusive "OR"(XOR) of the integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.Help Akito find the integers in the $$$n$$$-th row of the infinite triangle before the monsters reach the city.InputThe first line contains the integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.In the only line of each test case, there are two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^6,\ 1 \le k < 2^{31}$$$) — the row index that Akito needs and the integer in the first row of the Great Magical Triangle, respectively.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers — the elements of the $$$n$$$-th row of the Great Magical Triangle.ExampleInput51 52 103 169 11 52Output5

NoteIn the first example, the first row of the Great Magical Triangle is $$$[5]$$$ by definition.In the second example, $$$T_{2,1} = T_{1,1} = 10$$$ and $$$T_{2,2} = T_{1, 1} = 10$$$.
