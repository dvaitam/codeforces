A. FizzBuzz Remixedtime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFizzBuzz is one of the most well-known problems from coding interviews. In this problem, we will consider a remixed version of FizzBuzz:Given an integer $$$n$$$, process all integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$n$$$. For every integer such that its remainders modulo $$$3$$$ and modulo $$$5$$$ are the same (so, for every integer $$$i$$$ such that $$$i \bmod 3 = i \bmod 5$$$), print FizzBuzz.However, you don't have to solve it. Instead, given the integer $$$n$$$, you have to report how many times the correct solution to that problem will print FizzBuzz.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case contains one line consisting of one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$0 \le n \le 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, print one integer — the number of times the correct solution will print FizzBuzz with the given value of $$$n$$$.ExampleInput7051542133717101997998244353Output1

NoteIn the first test case, the solution will print FizzBuzz for the integer $$$0$$$.In the second test case, the solution will print FizzBuzz for the integers $$$0, 1, 2$$$.In the third test case, the solution will print FizzBuzz for the integers $$$0, 1, 2, 15$$$.
