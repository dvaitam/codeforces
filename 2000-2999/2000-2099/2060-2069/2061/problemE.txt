E. Kevin and Andtime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard output Kevin has an integer sequence $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. At the same time, Kevin has $$$m$$$ types of magic, where the $$$i$$$-th type of magic can be represented by an integer $$$b_i$$$.Kevin can perform at most $$$k$$$ (possibly zero) magic operations. In each operation, Kevin can do the following:  Choose two indices $$$i$$$ ($$$1\leq i\leq n$$$) and $$$j$$$ ($$$1\leq j\leq m$$$), and then update $$$a_i$$$ to $$$a_i\ \&\ b_j$$$. Here, $$$\&$$$ denotes the bitwise AND operation. Find the minimum possible sum of all numbers in the sequence $$$a$$$ after performing at most $$$k$$$ operations.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n, m, k$$$ ($$$1\leq n \leq 10^5$$$, $$$1\leq m \leq 10$$$, $$$0\leq k\leq nm$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$, the number of types of magic, and the maximum number of operations.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0\leq a_i < 2^{30}$$$).The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$0\leq b_i < 2^{30}$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$. OutputFor each test case, output one integer — the minimum possible sum of all numbers in the sequence $$$a$$$ after performing at most $$$k$$$ operations.ExampleInput51 3 275 6 32 3 25 65 6 310 2 53 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 37 85 1 01073741823 1073741823 1073741823 1073741823 107374182310737418231 1 000Output1

NoteIn the first test case, one possible way could be:  Update $$$a_1$$$ to $$$a_1\ \&\ b_1$$$. The sequence will become $$$[5]$$$.  Update $$$a_1$$$ to $$$a_1\ \&\ b_3$$$. The sequence will become $$$[1]$$$. In the second test case, one possible way could be:  Update $$$a_1$$$ to $$$a_1\ \&\ b_3$$$. The sequence will become $$$[1, 6]$$$.  Update $$$a_2$$$ to $$$a_2\ \&\ b_3$$$. The sequence will become $$$[1, 2]$$$.
