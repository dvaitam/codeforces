At this point, no one really knows how many times she has done this.Bob is given two sequences $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. All integers in the range from $$$1$$$ to $$$2n$$$ appear exactly once in either $$$a$$$ or $$$b$$$. In other words, the concatenated$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ sequence $$$a+b$$$ is a permutation$$$^{\text{†}}$$$ of length $$$2n$$$.Bob must sort both sequences in increasing order at the same time using Alice's swap function. Alice's swap function is implemented as follows:  Given two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$i \neq j$$$), it swaps $$$a_i$$$ with $$$b_j$$$, and swaps $$$b_i$$$ with $$$a_j$$$. Given sequences $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, please determine if both sequences can be sorted in increasing order simultaneously after using Alice's swap function any number of times.$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$The concatenated sequence $$$a+b$$$ denotes the sequence $$$[a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots , b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots]$$$.$$$^{\text{†}}$$$A permutation of length $$$m$$$ contains all integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ in some order.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 2n$$$).The third line of each test case contains $$$b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le 2n$$$).It is guaranteed that all integers in the range $$$[1,2n]$$$ appear exactly once in either $$$a$$$ or $$$b$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputIf it is possible to sort both sequences simultaneously, print "YES" on a new line. Otherwise, print "NO" on a new line.You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", and "Yes" will also be recognized as positive responses.ExampleInput532 1 34 6 532 1 54 3 641 6 4 35 2 8 745 3 7 18 6 4 275 1 9 12 3 13 72 4 11 14 6 10 8OutputNO

NoteIn the first test case, it can be shown that it is impossible.In the second test case, Bob can perform one operation with indices $$$i=1$$$ and $$$j=2$$$. The arrays become $$$[3,4,5]$$$ and $$$[1,2,6]$$$ respectively. Both arrays are now sorted.
