F. Multiplicative Arraystime limit per test4 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou're given integers $$$k$$$ and $$$n$$$. For each integer $$$x$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$, count the number of integer arrays $$$a$$$ such that all of the following are satisfied:  $$$1 \leq |a| \leq n$$$ where $$$|a|$$$ represents the length of $$$a$$$.  $$$1 \leq a_i \leq k$$$ for all $$$1 \leq i \leq |a|$$$.  $$$a_1 \times a_2 \times \dots \times a_{|a|}=x$$$ (i.e., the product of all elements is $$$x$$$). Note that two arrays $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$ are different if either their lengths are different, or if there exists an index $$$1 \leq i \leq |b|$$$ such that $$$b_i\neq c_i$$$.Output the answer modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t\leq 10^3$$$) — the number of independent test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$k$$$ and $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq k \leq 10^5, 1\leq n \leq 9\cdot 10^8$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output $$$k$$$ space-separated integers on a new line: the number of arrays for $$$x=1,2,\ldots,k$$$, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.ExampleInput32 24 310 6969420Output2 3
