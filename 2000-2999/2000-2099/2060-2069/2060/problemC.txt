C. Game of Mathletestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAlice and Bob are playing a game. There are $$$n$$$ ($$$n$$$ is even) integers written on a blackboard, represented by $$$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$$$. There is also a given integer $$$k$$$ and an integer score that is initially $$$0$$$. The game lasts for $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ turns, in which the following events happen sequentially:  Alice selects an integer from the blackboard and erases it. Let's call Alice's chosen integer $$$a$$$.  Bob selects an integer from the blackboard and erases it. Let's call Bob's chosen integer $$$b$$$.  If $$$a+b=k$$$, add $$$1$$$ to score. Alice is playing to minimize the score while Bob is playing to maximize the score. Assuming both players use optimal strategies, what is the score after the game ends?InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^5, 1 \leq k \leq 2\cdot n$$$, $$$n$$$ is even).The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq x_i \leq n$$$) — the integers on the blackboard.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the score if both players play optimally.ExampleInput44 41 2 3 28 151 2 3 4 5 6 7 86 11 1 1 1 1 116 93 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5 8 9 7 9 3Output2

NoteIn the first test case, one way the game may go is as follows:   Alice selects $$$1$$$ and Bob selects $$$3$$$. The score increases as $$$1+3=4$$$. Now the two integers remaining on the blackboard are $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$.  Alice and Bob both select $$$2$$$. The score increases as $$$2+2=4$$$.  The game ends as the blackboard now has no integers. In the third test case, it is impossible for the sum of Alice and Bob's selected integers to be $$$1$$$, so we answer $$$0$$$.Note that this is just an example of how the game may proceed for demonstration purposes. This may not be Alice or Bob's most optimal strategies.
