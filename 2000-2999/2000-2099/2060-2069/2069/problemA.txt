A. Was there an Array?time limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputFor an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$, we define its equality characteristic as the array $$$b_2, b_3, \dots, b_{n-1}$$$, where $$$b_i = 1$$$ if the $$$i$$$-th element of the array $$$a$$$ is equal to both of its neighbors, and $$$b_i = 0$$$ if the $$$i$$$-th element of the array $$$a$$$ is not equal to at least one of its neighbors.For example, for the array $$$[1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]$$$, the equality characteristic will be $$$[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]$$$.You are given the array $$$b_2, b_3, \dots, b_{n-1}$$$. Your task is to determine whether there exists such an array $$$a$$$ for which the given array is the equality characteristic.InputThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines:  the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 100$$$);  the second line contains $$$n-2$$$ integers $$$b_2, b_3, \dots, b_{n-1}$$$ ($$$0 \le b_i \le 1$$$). OutputFor each test case, output YES if the array $$$a$$$ exists, or NO if such an array does not exist. Each letter can be printed in any case.ExampleInput3100 1 0 0 0 0 1 131100 1 0 1 1 0 0 1OutputYES

NoteIn the first example, the array $$$a = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]$$$ is suitable.In the second example, the array $$$a = [7, 7, 7]$$$ is suitable.
