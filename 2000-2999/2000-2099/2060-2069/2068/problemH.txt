H. Statuestime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThe mayor of a city wants to place $$$n$$$ statues at intersections around the city. The intersections in the city are at all points $$$(x, y)$$$ with integer coordinates. Distances between intersections are measured using Manhattan distance, defined as follows: $$$$$$ \text{distance}((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|. $$$$$$The city council has provided the following requirements for the placement of the statues:   The first statue is placed at $$$(0, 0)$$$;  The $$$n$$$-th statue is placed at $$$(a, b)$$$;  For $$$i = 1, \dots, n-1$$$, the distance between the $$$i$$$-th statue and the $$$(i+1)$$$-th statue is $$$d_i$$$. It is allowed to place multiple statues at the same intersection.Help the mayor find a valid arrangement of the $$$n$$$ statues, or determine that it does not exist.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 50$$$) — the number of statues.The second line contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$0 \le a, b \le 10^9$$$) — the coordinates of the intersection where the $$$n$$$-th statue must be placed.The third line contains $$$n-1$$$ integers $$$d_1, \dots, d_{n-1}$$$ ($$$0 \le d_i \le 10^9$$$) — the distance between the $$$i$$$-th statue and the $$$(i+1)$$$-th statue.OutputPrint $$$\texttt{YES}$$$ if there is a valid arrangement of the $$$n$$$ statues. Otherwise, print $$$\texttt{NO}$$$.If there is a valid arrangement, print a valid arrangement in the following $$$n$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th of these lines must contain two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ — the coordinates of the intersection where the $$$i$$$-th statue is placed. You can print any valid arrangement if multiple exist.ExamplesInput35 89 0OutputNO

NoteIn the first sample, there is no valid arrangement of the 3 statues.In the second sample, the sample output is shown in the following picture. Note that this is not the only valid arrangement of the 4 statues.
