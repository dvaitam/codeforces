C. Devyatkinotime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputYou are given a positive integer $$$n$$$. In one operation, you can add to $$$n$$$ any positive integer whose decimal representation contains only the digit $$$9$$$, possibly repeated several times.What is the minimum number of operations needed to make the number $$$n$$$ contain at least one digit $$$7$$$ in its decimal representation?For example, if $$$n = 80$$$, it is sufficient to perform one operation: you can add $$$99$$$ to $$$n$$$, after the operation $$$n = 179$$$, which contains the digit $$$7$$$.InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$10 \leq n \leq 10^9$$$).OutputFor each test case, output the minimum number of operations required for the number $$$n$$$ to contain the digit $$$7$$$.ExampleInput16516061777123456891000000000200230019779898989868080000196701590Output3

NoteIn the first test case, three operations are sufficient: $$$51 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 78$$$, which contains the digit $$$7$$$. It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve the goal in one or two operations.In the second test case, two operations are sufficient: $$$60 + 9 + 9 = 78$$$.In the third test case, one operation is sufficient: $$$61 + 9 = 70$$$.In the fourth test case, $$$n$$$ already contains the digit $$$7$$$, so no operations are required.In the fifth test case, you can add $$$99$$$ to $$$n$$$ to obtain a number containing the digit $$$7$$$.
