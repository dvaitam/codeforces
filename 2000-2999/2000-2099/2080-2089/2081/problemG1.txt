G1. Hard Formulatime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test1024 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThis is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, the limits on $$$n$$$ and the time limit are smaller. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem. You are given an integer $$$n$$$, and you need to compute $$$(\sum_{k=1}^n k\bmod\varphi(k))\bmod 2^{32}$$$, where $$$\varphi(k)$$$ equals the number of positive integers no greater than $$$k$$$ that are coprime with $$$k$$$.InputThe only line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^{10})$$$.OutputPrint a single integer, representing $$$(\sum_{k=1}^n k\bmod\varphi(k))\bmod 2^{32}$$$.ExamplesInput5Output2
