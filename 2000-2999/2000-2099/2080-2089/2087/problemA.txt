Password Generatortime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputMonocarp is going to register on the Codeforces website, but he can't come up with a sufficiently secure password. The requirements that his password must meet are as follows:  the password must consist of digits, as well as uppercase and lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet;  there must be exactly $$$a$$$ digits, exactly $$$b$$$ uppercase letters, and exactly $$$c$$$ lowercase letters;  for security, no two adjacent characters in the password should be the same. The lowercase and uppercase versions of the same letter are considered different characters. Write a program that generates a password that meets all the requirements.InputThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b, c \le 10$$$).OutputFor each test case, output one line containing any suitable password. It can be shown that there is always at least one password that meets the requirements.ExampleInput22 1 63 3 6OutputabaCaba42
