A. King Keykhosrow's Mysterytime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputThere is a tale about the wise King Keykhosrow who owned a grand treasury filled with treasures from across the Persian Empire. However, to prevent theft and ensure the safety of his wealth, King Keykhosrow's vault was sealed with a magical lock that could only be opened by solving a riddle.  The riddle involves two sacred numbers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. To unlock the vault, the challenger must determine the smallest key number $$$m$$$ that satisfies two conditions:   $$$m$$$ must be greater than or equal to at least one of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.  The remainder when $$$m$$$ is divided by $$$a$$$ must be equal to the remainder when $$$m$$$ is divided by $$$b$$$. Only by finding the smallest correct value of $$$m$$$ can one unlock the vault and access the legendary treasures!InputThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$), the number of test cases.Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \leq a, b \leq 1000$$$).OutputFor each test case, print the smallest integer $$$m$$$ that satisfies the conditions above.ExampleInput24 6472 896Output12

NoteIn the first test case, you can see that:   $$$4 \bmod 4 = 0$$$ but $$$4 \bmod 6 = 4$$$  $$$5 \bmod 4 = 1$$$ but $$$5 \bmod 6 = 5$$$  $$$6 \bmod 4 = 2$$$ but $$$6 \bmod 6 = 0$$$  $$$7 \bmod 4 = 3$$$ but $$$7 \bmod 6 = 1$$$  $$$8 \bmod 4 = 0$$$ but $$$8 \bmod 6 = 2$$$  $$$9 \bmod 4 = 1$$$ but $$$9 \bmod 6 = 3$$$  $$$10 \bmod 4 = 2$$$ but $$$10 \bmod 6 = 4$$$  $$$11 \bmod 4 = 3$$$ but $$$11 \bmod 6 = 5$$$  so no integer less than $$$12$$$ satisfies the desired properties.
