A. A Gift From Orangutantime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputWhile exploring the jungle, you have bumped into a rare orangutan with a bow tie! You shake hands with the orangutan and offer him some food and water. In return...The orangutan has gifted you an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Using $$$a$$$, you will construct two arrays $$$b$$$ and $$$c$$$, both containing $$$n$$$ elements, in the following manner:  $$$b_i = \min(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_i)$$$ for each $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$.  $$$c_i = \max(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_i)$$$ for each $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$. Define the score of $$$a$$$ as $$$\sum_{i=1}^n c_i - b_i$$$ (i.e. the sum of $$$c_i - b_i$$$ over all $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$). Before you calculate the score, you can shuffle the elements of $$$a$$$ however you want.Find the maximum score that you can get if you shuffle the elements of $$$a$$$ optimally.InputThe first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 1000$$$) — the number of elements in $$$a$$$.The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 1000$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.OutputFor each test case, output the maximum score that you can get.ExampleInput316937 6 551 1 1 2 2Output0

NoteIn the first test case, there is no other way to rearrange $$$a$$$. So, $$$b = [69]$$$ and $$$c = [69]$$$. The only possible score is $$$69 - 69 = 0$$$.In the second test case, you can rearrange $$$a$$$ as $$$[7, 5, 6]$$$. Here, $$$b = [7, 5, 5]$$$ and $$$c = [7, 7, 7]$$$. The score in this case is $$$(7 - 7) + (7 - 5) + (7 - 5) = 4$$$. It can be shown this is the maximum possible score.
