F. Orangutan Approved Subarraystime limit per test3 secondsmemory limit per test512 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputSuppose you have an array $$$b$$$. Initially, you also have a set $$$S$$$ that contains all distinct elements of $$$b$$$. The array $$$b$$$ is called orangutan-approved if it can be emptied by repeatedly performing the following operation:   In one operation, select indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq |b|$$$) such that $$$v = b_l = b_{l+1} = \ldots = b_r$$$ and $$$v$$$ is present in $$$S$$$. Remove $$$v$$$ from $$$S$$$, and simultaneously remove all $$$b_i$$$ such that $$$l \leq i \leq r$$$. Then, reindex the elements $$$b_{r+1}, b_{r+2}, \ldots$$$ as $$$b_l, b_{l+1}, \ldots$$$ accordingly. You are given an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ queries. Each query consists of two indices $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$), and you need to determine whether or not the subarray $$$a_{l}, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r$$$ is orangutan-approved.InputThe first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq n,q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the size of $$$a$$$ and the number of queries, respectively.The following line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.The following $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ — the endpoints of the subarray for each query ($$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each query, output "YES" (without quotes) if the subarray from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ is orangutan-approved, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yES", "yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).ExampleInput34 21 2 2 11 41 35 31 2 1 2 12 53 51 38 41 2 3 2 1 3 2 31 52 83 56 8OutputYES

NoteIn the first query of the first testcase, the answer is YES.   Initially, $$$S=\{1,2\}$$$ and $$$b=[1,2,2,1]$$$  Select $$$l=2$$$ and $$$r=3$$$. Since $$$b_2=b_3=2$$$ is in $$$S$$$, we may erase $$$b_2$$$ and $$$b_3$$$ from the array, as well as erasing $$$2$$$ from $$$S$$$. The set $$$S$$$ becomes $$$\{1\}$$$ and the array becomes $$$[1,1]$$$.  Select $$$l=1$$$ and $$$r=2$$$. Since $$$b_1=b_2=1$$$ is in $$$S$$$, we may erase $$$b_1$$$ and $$$b_2$$$ from the array, as well as erasing $$$1$$$ from $$$S$$$. The set $$$S$$$ becomes $$$\{\}$$$ and the array becomes $$$[]$$$.  Since the array is now empty, we can say the original array is orangutan-approved. In the first query of the second testcase, the answer is NO, because it can be shown that the subarray $$$[2,1,2,1]$$$ cannot become empty through any sequence of valid operations.
