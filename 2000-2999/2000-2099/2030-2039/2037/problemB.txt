Intercepted Inputstime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputTo help you prepare for your upcoming Codeforces contest, Citlali set a grid problem and is trying to give you a $$$n$$$ by $$$m$$$ grid through your input stream. Specifically, your input stream should contain the following:  The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ — the dimensions of the grid.  The following $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$m$$$ integers each — the values of the grid. However, someone has intercepted your input stream, shuffled all given integers, and put them all on one line! Now, there are $$$k$$$ integers all on one line, and you don't know where each integer originally belongs. Instead of asking Citlali to resend the input, you decide to determine the values of $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ yourself.Output any possible value of $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ that Citlali could have provided.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the total number of inputs in your input stream.The following line of each test case contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq k$$$) — the shuffled inputs of your input stream. It is guaranteed that $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ are contained within the $$$k$$$ integers.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$k$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output two integers, one possible value of $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$. If multiple possible answers exist, output any.ExampleInput531 1 2113 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 9 10 1188 4 8 3 8 2 8 162 1 4 5 3 381 2 6 3 8 5 5 3Output1 1
