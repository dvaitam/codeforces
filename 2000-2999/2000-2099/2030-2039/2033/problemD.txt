D. Kousuke's Assignmenttime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputAfter a trip with Sakurako, Kousuke was very scared because he forgot about his programming assignment. In this assignment, the teacher gave him an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers and asked him to calculate the number of non-overlapping segments of the array $$$a$$$, such that each segment is considered beautiful.A segment $$$[l,r]$$$ is considered beautiful if $$$a_l + a_{l+1} + \dots + a_{r-1} + a_r=0$$$.For a fixed array $$$a$$$, your task is to compute the maximum number of non-overlapping beautiful segments.InputThe first line of input contains the number $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of $$$2$$$ lines.   The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$-10^5 \le a_i \le 10^5$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$3\cdot 10^5$$$.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-overlapping beautiful segments.ExampleInput352 1 -3 2 1712 -4 4 43 -3 -5 860 -4 0 3 0 1Output1
