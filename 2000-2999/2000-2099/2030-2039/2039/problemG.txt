G. Shohag Loves Pebaetime limit per test5 secondsmemory limit per test768 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputShohag has a tree with $$$n$$$ nodes.Pebae has an integer $$$m$$$. She wants to assign each node a value — an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. So she asks Shohag to count the number, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$, of assignments such that following conditions are satisfied:  For each pair $$$1 \le u \lt v \le n$$$, the least common multiple (LCM) of the values of the nodes in the unique simple path from $$$u$$$ to $$$v$$$ is not divisible by the number of nodes in the path.  The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the values of all nodes from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ is $$$1$$$. But this problem is too hard for Shohag to solve. As Shohag loves Pebae, he has to solve the problem. Please save Shohag!InputThe first line contains two space-separated integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^6$$$, $$$1 \le m \le 10^{9}$$$).Each of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \le u, v \le n$$$) indicating there is an edge between vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.OutputPrint a single integer — the number of valid ways to assign each vertex a value, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.ExamplesInput6 61 22 33 44 53 6Output2

NoteIn the first test case, the valid assignments are $$$[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$$$ and $$$[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5]$$$.In the second test case, the valid assignments are $$$[1, 1]$$$, $$$[1, 3]$$$, $$$[1, 5]$$$, $$$[3, 1]$$$, $$$[3, 5]$$$, $$$[5, 1]$$$ and $$$[5, 3]$$$.
