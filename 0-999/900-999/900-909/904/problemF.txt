Description:
Priests of the Quetzalcoatl cult want to build a tower to represent a power of their god. Tower is usually made of power-charged rocks. It is built with the help of rare magic by levitating the current top of tower and adding rocks at its bottom. If top, which is built from k - 1 rocks, possesses power p and we want to add the rock charged with power wk then value of power of a new tower will be {wk}p.

Rocks are added from the last to the first. That is for sequence w1, ..., wm value of power will be

$${ w _ { 1 } \left( { w _ { 2 } ^ { ( w _ { 3 } ^ { \cdots w _ { m } } ) } } \right) }$$

After tower is built, its power may be extremely large. But still priests want to get some information about it, namely they want to know a number called cumulative power which is the true value of power taken modulo m. Priests have n rocks numbered from 1 to n. They ask you to calculate which value of cumulative power will the tower possess if they will build it from rocks numbered l, l + 1, ..., r.

Input Format:
First line of input contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 109).

Second line of input contains n integers wk (1 ≤ wk ≤ 109) which is the power of rocks that priests have.

Third line of input contains single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 105) which is amount of queries from priests to you.

kth of next q lines contains two integers lk and rk (1 ≤ lk ≤ rk ≤ n).

Output Format:
Output q integers. k-th of them must be the amount of cumulative power the tower will have if is built from rocks lk, lk + 1, ..., rk.
