Description:
Given an integer N, find two permutations:

1. Permutation p of numbers from 1 to N such that pi ≠ i and pi & i = 0 for all i = 1, 2, ..., N.
2. Permutation q of numbers from 1 to N such that qi ≠ i and qi & i ≠ 0 for all i = 1, 2, ..., N.

& is the bitwise AND operation.

Input Format:
The input consists of one line containing a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 105).

Output Format:
For each subtask, if the required permutation doesn't exist, output a single line containing the word "NO"; otherwise output the word "YES" in the first line and N elements of the permutation, separated by spaces, in the second line. If there are several possible permutations in a subtask, output any of them.

Note:
None
