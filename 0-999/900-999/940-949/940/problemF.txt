Description:
You come home and fell some unpleasant smell. Where is it coming from?

You are given an array a. You have to answer the following queries:

1. You are given two integers l and r. Let ci be the number of occurrences of i in al: r, where al: r is the subarray of a from l-th element to r-th inclusive. Find the Mex of {c0, c1, ..., c109}
2. You are given two integers p to x. Change ap to x.

The Mex of a multiset of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

Note that in this problem all elements of a are positive, which means that c0 = 0 and 0 is never the answer for the query of the second type.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains two integers n and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 100 000) — the length of the array and the number of queries respectively.

The second line of input contains n integers — a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

Each of the next q lines describes a single query.

The first type of query is described by three integers ti = 1, li, ri, where 1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n — the bounds of the subarray.

The second type of query is described by three integers ti = 2, pi, xi, where 1 ≤ pi ≤ n is the index of the element, which must be changed and 1 ≤ xi ≤ 109 is the new value.

Output Format:
For each query of the first type output a single integer  — the Mex of {c0, c1, ..., c109}.

Note:
The subarray of the first query consists of the single element — 1.

The subarray of the second query consists of four 2s, one 3 and two 1s.

The subarray of the fourth query consists of three 1s, three 2s and one 3.
