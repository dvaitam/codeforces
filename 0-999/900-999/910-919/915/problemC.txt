Description:
You are given two positive integer numbers a and b. Permute (change order) of the digits of a to construct maximal number not exceeding b. No number in input and/or output can start with the digit 0.

It is allowed to leave a as it is.

Input Format:
The first line contains integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 1018). The second line contains integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 1018). Numbers don't have leading zeroes. It is guaranteed that answer exists.

Output Format:
Print the maximum possible number that is a permutation of digits of a and is not greater than b. The answer can't have any leading zeroes. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

The number in the output should have exactly the same length as number a. It should be a permutation of digits of a.

Note:
None
