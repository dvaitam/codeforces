Description:
An atom of element X can exist in n distinct states with energies E1 < E2 < ... < En. Arkady wants to build a laser on this element, using a three-level scheme. Here is a simplified description of the scheme.

Three distinct states i, j and k are selected, where i < j < k. After that the following process happens:

1. initially the atom is in the state i,
2. we spend Ek - Ei energy to put the atom in the state k,
3. the atom emits a photon with useful energy Ek - Ej and changes its state to the state j,
4. the atom spontaneously changes its state to the state i, losing energy Ej - Ei,
5. the process repeats from step 1.

Let's define the energy conversion efficiency as $$\eta = \frac{E_k - E_j}{E_k - E_i}$$, i. e. the ration between the useful energy of the photon and spent energy.

Due to some limitations, Arkady can only choose such three states that Ek - Ei ≤ U.

Help Arkady to find such the maximum possible energy conversion efficiency within the above constraints.

Input Format:
The first line contains two integers n and U (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ U ≤ 109) — the number of states and the maximum possible difference between Ek and Ei.

The second line contains a sequence of integers E1, E2, ..., En (1 ≤ E1 < E2... < En ≤ 109). It is guaranteed that all Ei are given in increasing order.

Output Format:
If it is not possible to choose three states that satisfy all constraints, print -1.

Otherwise, print one real number η — the maximum possible energy conversion efficiency. Your answer is considered correct its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 9.

Formally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct if $$\frac{|a-b|}{\max(1, |b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$$.

Note:
In the first example choose states 1, 2 and 3, so that the energy conversion efficiency becomes equal to $$\eta = \frac{5-3}{5-1} = 0.5$$.

In the second example choose states 4, 5 and 9, so that the energy conversion efficiency becomes equal to $$\eta = \frac{24-17}{24-16} = 0.875$$.
