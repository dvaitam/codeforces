Description:
Let D(x) be the number of positive divisors of a positive integer x. For example, D(2) = 2 (2 is divisible by 1 and 2), D(6) = 4 (6 is divisible by 1, 2, 3 and 6).

You are given an array a of n integers. You have to process two types of queries:

1. REPLACE l r — for every $$i \in [l, r]$$ replace ai with D(ai);
2. SUM l r — calculate $$\sum_{i=l}^{r}a_i$$.

Print the answer for each SUM query.

Input Format:
The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 3·105) — the number of elements in the array and the number of queries to process, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 106) — the elements of the array.

Then m lines follow, each containing 3 integers ti, li, ri denoting i-th query. If ti = 1, then i-th query is REPLACE li ri, otherwise it's SUM li ri (1 ≤ ti ≤ 2, 1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n).

There is at least one SUM query.

Output Format:
For each SUM query print the answer to it.

Note:
None
