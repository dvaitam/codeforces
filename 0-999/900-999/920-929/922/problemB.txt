Description:
Imp is in a magic forest, where xorangles grow (wut?)

A xorangle of order n is such a non-degenerate triangle, that lengths of its sides are integers not exceeding n, and the xor-sum of the lengths is equal to zero. Imp has to count the number of distinct xorangles of order n to get out of the forest.

Formally, for a given integer n you have to find the number of such triples (a, b, c), that:

- 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ n;
- $$a \oplus b \oplus c = 0$$, where $$x \oplus y$$ denotes the bitwise xor of integers x and y.
- (a, b, c) form a non-degenerate (with strictly positive area) triangle.

Input Format:
The only line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2500).

Output Format:
Print the number of xorangles of order n.

Note:
The only xorangle in the first sample is (3, 5, 6).
