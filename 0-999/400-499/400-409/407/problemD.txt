Description:
You are given matrix a of size n × m, its elements are integers. We will assume that the rows of the matrix are numbered from top to bottom from 1 to n, the columns are numbered from left to right from 1 to m. We will denote the element on the intersecting of the i-th row and the j-th column as aij.

We'll call submatrix i1, j1, i2, j2 (1 ≤ i1 ≤ i2 ≤ n; 1 ≤ j1 ≤ j2 ≤ m) such elements aij of the given matrix that i1 ≤ i ≤ i2 AND j1 ≤ j ≤ j2. We'll call the area of the submatrix number (i2 - i1 + 1)·(j2 - j1 + 1). We'll call a submatrix inhomogeneous, if all its elements are distinct.

Find the largest (in area) inhomogenous submatrix of the given matrix.

Input Format:
The first line contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 400) — the number of rows and columns of the matrix, correspondingly.

Each of the next n lines contains m integers aij (1 ≤ aij ≤ 160000) — the elements of the matrix.

Output Format:
Print a single integer — the area of the optimal inhomogenous submatrix.

Note:
None
