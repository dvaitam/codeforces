Description:
Little X has met the following problem recently.

Let's define f(x) as the sum of digits in decimal representation of number x (for example, f(1234) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4). You are to calculate $$\sum_{i=l}^{r} f(i) \bmod a.$$

Of course Little X has solved this problem quickly, has locked it, and then has tried to hack others. He has seen the following C++ code:

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 1018).

Output Format:
Print two integers: l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10200) — the required test data. Leading zeros aren't allowed. It's guaranteed that the solution exists.

Note:
None
