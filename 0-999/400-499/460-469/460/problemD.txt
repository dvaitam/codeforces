Description:
Little Victor adores the sets theory. Let us remind you that a set is a group of numbers where all numbers are pairwise distinct. Today Victor wants to find a set of integers S that has the following properties:

- for all x $$( x \in S )$$ the following inequality holds l ≤ x ≤ r;
- 1 ≤ |S| ≤ k;
- lets denote the i-th element of the set S as si; value $$f(S) = s_1 \oplus s_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus s_{|S|}$$ must be as small as possible.

Help Victor find the described set.

Input Format:
The first line contains three space-separated integers l, r, k (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 1012; 1 ≤ k ≤ min(106, r - l + 1)).

Output Format:
Print the minimum possible value of f(S). Then print the cardinality of set |S|. Then print the elements of the set in any order.

If there are multiple optimal sets, you can print any of them.

Note:
Operation $$x \oplus y$$ represents the operation of bitwise exclusive OR. In other words, it is the XOR operation.
