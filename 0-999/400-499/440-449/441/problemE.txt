Description:
Valera is a coder. Recently he wrote a funny program. The pseudo code for this program is given below:

Now Valera wonders: given the values x, k and p, what is the expected value of the resulting number s?

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains three integers x, k, p (1 ≤ x ≤ 109; 1 ≤ k ≤ 200; 0 ≤ p ≤ 100).

Output Format:
Print the required expected value. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 6.
