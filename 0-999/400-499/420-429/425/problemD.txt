Description:
Sereja has painted n distinct points on the plane. The coordinates of each point are integers. Now he is wondering: how many squares are there with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with points painted in all its four vertexes? Help him, calculate this number.

Input Format:
The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). Each of the next n lines contains two integers xi, yi (0 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 105), the integers represent the coordinates of the i-th point. It is guaranteed that all the given points are distinct.

Output Format:
In a single line print the required number of squares.

Note:
None
