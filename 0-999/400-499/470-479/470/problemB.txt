Description:
This (unpronounceable) word means simply fear of number 666.

You are given a string of digits. Check whether it is scary for a person suffering from this phobia, i.e., whether it contains number 666 as a substring.

Input Format:
The input will consist of a single string p. The string contains between 1 and 100 digits ('0'-'9'), inclusive. The string doesn't contain any other characters except digits.

Output Format:
Output "YES" if given string contains number 666, and "NO" otherwise (quotes for clarity only).

Note:
Note that 666 must be a contiguous substring of p, not a subsequence (see sample 3).
