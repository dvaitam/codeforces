Description:
We'll call an array of n non-negative integers a[1], a[2], ..., a[n] interesting, if it meets m constraints. The i-th of the m constraints consists of three integers li, ri, qi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n) meaning that value $$a[l_{i}] \& a[l_{i}+1] \& \ldots \& a[r_{i}]$$ should be equal to qi.

Your task is to find any interesting array of n elements or state that such array doesn't exist.

Expression x&y means the bitwise AND of numbers x and y. In programming languages C++, Java and Python this operation is represented as "&", in Pascal — as "and".

Input Format:
The first line contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105) — the number of elements in the array and the number of limits.

Each of the next m lines contains three integers li, ri, qi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n, 0 ≤ qi < 230) describing the i-th limit.

Output Format:
If the interesting array exists, in the first line print "YES" (without the quotes) and in the second line print n integers a[1], a[2], ..., a[n] (0 ≤ a[i] < 230) decribing the interesting array. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

If the interesting array doesn't exist, print "NO" (without the quotes) in the single line.

Note:
None
