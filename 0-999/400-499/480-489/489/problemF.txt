Description:
An n × n square matrix is special, if:

- it is binary, that is, each cell contains either a 0, or a 1;
- the number of ones in each row and column equals 2.

You are given n and the first m rows of the matrix. Print the number of special n × n matrices, such that the first m rows coincide with the given ones.

As the required value can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the value by the given number mod.

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains three integers n, m, mod (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 0 ≤ m ≤ n, 2 ≤ mod ≤ 109). Then m lines follow, each of them contains n characters — the first rows of the required special matrices. Each of these lines contains exactly two characters '1', the rest characters are '0'. Each column of the given m × n table contains at most two numbers one.

Output Format:
Print the remainder after dividing the required value by number mod.

Note:
For the first test the required matrices are:

In the second test the required matrix is already fully given, so the answer is 1.
