Description:
You are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. Determine whether there's a pair of integers a, b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n; a ≠ b) such that the element $${ \frac { ( a + b ) } { 2 } }$$ (note, that it is usual division, not integer one) is between a and b in this permutation.

Input Format:
First line consists of a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300000) — the size of permutation.

Second line contains n integers — the permutation itself.

Output Format:
Print "YES", if such a pair exists, "NO" otherwise (in both cases without quotes, the answer is case insensitive).

Note:
In the second example 2 is between 1 and 3. Additionally 4 is between 3 and 5.
