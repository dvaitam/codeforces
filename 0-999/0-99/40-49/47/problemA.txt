Description:
A triangular number is the number of dots in an equilateral triangle uniformly filled with dots. For example, three dots can be arranged in a triangle; thus three is a triangular number. The n-th triangular number is the number of dots in a triangle with n dots on a side. $$T_{n}=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$. You can learn more about these numbers from Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number).
