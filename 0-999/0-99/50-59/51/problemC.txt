Description:
The New Vasjuki village is stretched along the motorway and that's why every house on it is characterized by its shift relative to some fixed point — the xi coordinate. The village consists of n houses, the i-th house is located in the point with coordinates of xi.

TELE3, a cellular communication provider planned to locate three base stations so as to provide every house in the village with cellular communication. The base station having power d located in the point t provides with communication all the houses on the segment [t - d, t + d] (including boundaries).

To simplify the integration (and simply not to mix anything up) all the three stations are planned to possess the equal power of d. Which minimal value of d is enough to provide all the houses in the village with cellular communication.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105) which represents the number of houses in the village. The second line contains the coordinates of houses — the sequence x1, x2, ..., xn of integer numbers (1 ≤ xi ≤ 109). It is possible that two or more houses are located on one point. The coordinates are given in a arbitrary order.

Output Format:
Print the required minimal power d. In the second line print three numbers — the possible coordinates of the base stations' location. Print the coordinates with 6 digits after the decimal point. The positions of the stations can be any from 0 to 2·109 inclusively. It is accepted for the base stations to have matching coordinates. If there are many solutions, print any of them.

Note:
None
