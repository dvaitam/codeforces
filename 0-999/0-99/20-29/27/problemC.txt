Description:
The sequence is called ordered if it is non-decreasing or non-increasing. For example, sequnces [3, 1, 1, 0] and [1, 2, 3, 100] are ordered, but the sequence [1, 3, 3, 1] is not. You are given a sequence of numbers. You are to find it's shortest subsequence which is not ordered.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105). The second line contains n space-separated integers — the given sequence. All numbers in this sequence do not exceed 106 by absolute value.

Output Format:
If the given sequence does not contain any unordered subsequences, output 0. Otherwise, output the length k of the shortest such subsequence. Then output k integers from the range [1..n] — indexes of the elements of this subsequence. If there are several solutions, output any of them.

Note:
None
