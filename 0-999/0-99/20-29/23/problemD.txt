Description:
You're given the centers of three equal sides of a strictly convex tetragon. Your task is to restore the initial tetragon.

Input Format:
The first input line contains one number T — amount of tests (1 ≤ T ≤ 5·104). Each of the following T lines contains numbers x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 — coordinates of different points that are the centers of three equal sides (non-negative integer numbers, not exceeding 10).

Output Format:
For each test output two lines. If the required tetragon exists, output in the first line YES, in the second line — four pairs of numbers — coordinates of the polygon's vertices in clockwise or counter-clockwise order. Don't forget, please, that the tetragon should be strictly convex, i.e. no 3 of its points lie on one line. Output numbers with 9 characters after a decimal point.

If the required tetragon doen't exist, output NO in the first line, and leave the second line empty.

Note:
None
