Description:
One day n cells of some array decided to play the following game. Initially each cell contains a number which is equal to it's ordinal number (starting from 1). Also each cell determined it's favourite number. On it's move i-th cell can exchange it's value with the value of some other j-th cell, if |i - j| = di, where di is a favourite number of i-th cell. Cells make moves in any order, the number of moves is unlimited.

The favourite number of each cell will be given to you. You will also be given a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. You are to determine whether the game could move to this state.

Input Format:
The first line contains positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of cells in the array. The second line contains n distinct integers from 1 to n — permutation. The last line contains n integers from 1 to n — favourite numbers of the cells.

Output Format:
If the given state is reachable in the described game, output YES, otherwise NO.

Note:
None
