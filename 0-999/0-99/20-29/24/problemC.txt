Description:
You are given the following points with integer coordinates on the plane: M0, A0, A1, ..., An - 1, where n is odd number. Now we define the following infinite sequence of points Mi: Mi is symmetric to Mi - 1 according $${ A } _ { ( i - 1 ) \mod n }$$ (for every natural number i). Here point B is symmetric to A according M, if M is the center of the line segment AB. Given index j find the point Mj.

Input Format:
On the first line you will be given an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), which will be odd, and j (1 ≤ j ≤ 1018), where j is the index of the desired point. The next line contains two space separated integers, the coordinates of M0. After that n lines follow, where the i-th line contain the space separated integer coordinates of the point Ai - 1. The absolute values of all input coordinates will not be greater then 1000.

Output Format:
On a single line output the coordinates of Mj, space separated.

Note:
