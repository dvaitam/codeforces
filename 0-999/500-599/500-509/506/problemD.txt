Description:
Mr. Kitayuta has just bought an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges. The vertices of the graph are numbered from 1 to n. Each edge, namely edge i, has a color ci, connecting vertex ai and bi.

Mr. Kitayuta wants you to process the following q queries.

In the i-th query, he gives you two integers - ui and vi.

Find the number of the colors that satisfy the following condition: the edges of that color connect vertex ui and vertex vi directly or indirectly.

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains space-separated two integers - n and m(2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105), denoting the number of the vertices and the number of the edges, respectively.

The next m lines contain space-separated three integers - ai, bi(1 ≤ ai < bi ≤ n) and ci(1 ≤ ci ≤ m). Note that there can be multiple edges between two vertices. However, there are no multiple edges of the same color between two vertices, that is, if i ≠ j, (ai, bi, ci) ≠ (aj, bj, cj).

The next line contains a integer- q(1 ≤ q ≤ 105), denoting the number of the queries.

Then follows q lines, containing space-separated two integers - ui and vi(1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n). It is guaranteed that ui ≠ vi.

Output Format:
For each query, print the answer in a separate line.

Note:
Let's consider the first sample.

The figure above shows the first sample.

- Vertex 1 and vertex 2 are connected by color 1 and 2.
- Vertex 3 and vertex 4 are connected by color 3.
- Vertex 1 and vertex 4 are not connected by any single color.
