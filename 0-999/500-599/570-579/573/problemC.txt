Description:
Limak is a little bear who learns to draw. People usually start with houses, fences and flowers but why would bears do it? Limak lives in the forest and he decides to draw a tree.

Recall that tree is a connected graph consisting of n vertices and n - 1 edges.

Limak chose a tree with n vertices. He has infinite strip of paper with two parallel rows of dots. Little bear wants to assign vertices of a tree to some n distinct dots on a paper so that edges would intersect only at their endpoints — drawn tree must be planar. Below you can see one of correct drawings for the first sample test.

Is it possible for Limak to draw chosen tree?

Input Format:
The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).

Next n - 1 lines contain description of a tree. i-th of them contains two space-separated integers ai and bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi) denoting an edge between vertices ai and bi. It's guaranteed that given description forms a tree.

Output Format:
Print "Yes" (without the quotes) if Limak can draw chosen tree. Otherwise, print "No" (without the quotes).

Note:
None
