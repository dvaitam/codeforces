Description:
Fox Ciel is participating in a party in Prime Kingdom. There are n foxes there (include Fox Ciel). The i-th fox is ai years old.

They will have dinner around some round tables. You want to distribute foxes such that:

1. Each fox is sitting at some table.
2. Each table has at least 3 foxes sitting around it.
3. The sum of ages of any two adjacent foxes around each table should be a prime number.

If k foxes f1, f2, ..., fk are sitting around table in clockwise order, then for 1 ≤ i ≤ k - 1: fi and fi + 1 are adjacent, and f1 and fk are also adjacent.

If it is possible to distribute the foxes in the desired manner, find out a way to do that.

Input Format:
The first line contains single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 200): the number of foxes in this party.

The second line contains n integers ai (2 ≤ ai ≤ 104).

Output Format:
If it is impossible to do this, output "Impossible".

Otherwise, in the first line output an integer m ($$1 \leq m \leq \frac{n}{3}$$): the number of tables.

Then output m lines, each line should start with an integer k -=– the number of foxes around that table, and then k numbers — indices of fox sitting around that table in clockwise order.

If there are several possible arrangements, output any of them.

Note:
In example 1, they can sit around one table, their ages are: 3-8-9-4, adjacent sums are: 11, 17, 13 and 7, all those integers are primes.

In example 2, it is not possible: the sum of 2+2 = 4 is not a prime number.
