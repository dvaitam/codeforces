Description:
Mike is the president of country What-The-Fatherland. There are n bears living in this country besides Mike. All of them are standing in a line and they are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. i-th bear is exactly ai feet high.

A group of bears is a non-empty contiguous segment of the line. The size of a group is the number of bears in that group. The strength of a group is the minimum height of the bear in that group.

Mike is a curious to know for each x such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n the maximum strength among all groups of size x.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 105), the number of bears.

The second line contains n integers separated by space, a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109), heights of bears.

Output Format:
Print n integers in one line. For each x from 1 to n, print the maximum strength among all groups of size x.

Note:
None
