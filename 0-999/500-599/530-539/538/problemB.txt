B. Quasi Binarytime limit per test2 secondsmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputA number is called quasibinary if its decimal representation contains only digits 0 or 1. For example, numbers 0, 1, 101, 110011 — are quasibinary and numbers 2, 12, 900 are not.You are given a positive integer n. Represent it as a sum of minimum number of quasibinary numbers.InputThe first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106).OutputIn the first line print a single integer k — the minimum number of numbers in the representation of number n as a sum of quasibinary numbers.In the second line print k numbers — the elements of the sum. All these numbers should be quasibinary according to the definition above, their sum should equal n. Do not have to print the leading zeroes in the numbers. The order of numbers doesn't matter. If there are multiple possible representations, you are allowed to print any of them.ExamplesInput9Output91 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Input32Output310 11 11
