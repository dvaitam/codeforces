Description:
Karafs is some kind of vegetable in shape of an 1 × h rectangle. Tavaspolis people love Karafs and they use Karafs in almost any kind of food. Tavas, himself, is crazy about Karafs.

Each Karafs has a positive integer height. Tavas has an infinite 1-based sequence of Karafses. The height of the i-th Karafs is si = A + (i - 1) × B.

For a given m, let's define an m-bite operation as decreasing the height of at most m distinct not eaten Karafses by 1. Karafs is considered as eaten when its height becomes zero.

Now SaDDas asks you n queries. In each query he gives you numbers l, t and m and you should find the largest number r such that l ≤ r and sequence sl, sl + 1, ..., sr can be eaten by performing m-bite no more than t times or print -1 if there is no such number r.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains three integers A, B and n (1 ≤ A, B ≤ 106, 1 ≤ n ≤ 105).

Next n lines contain information about queries. i-th line contains integers l, t, m (1 ≤ l, t, m ≤ 106) for i-th query.

Output Format:
For each query, print its answer in a single line.

Note:
None
