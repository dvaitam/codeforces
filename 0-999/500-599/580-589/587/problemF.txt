Description:
Duff is mad at her friends. That's why she sometimes makes Malek to take candy from one of her friends for no reason!

She has n friends. Her i-th friend's name is si (their names are not necessarily unique). q times, she asks Malek to take candy from her friends. She's angry, but also she acts with rules. When she wants to ask Malek to take candy from one of her friends, like k, she chooses two numbers l and r and tells Malek to take exactly $$\sum_{i=l}^{r} occur(s_i, s_k)$$ candies from him/her, where occur(t, s) is the number of occurrences of string t in s.

Malek is not able to calculate how many candies to take in each request from Duff. That's why she asked for your help. Please tell him how many candies to take in each request.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains two integers n and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 105).

The next n lines contain the names. i-th of them contains an string si, consisting of lowercase English letters   ($$1 \leq \sum_{i=1}^{n} |s_i| \leq 10^5$$).

The next q lines contain the requests. Each of them contains three integers, l, r and k (says that Malek should take $$\sum_{i=l}^{r} occur(s_i, s_k)$$ candies from Duff's k-th friend).

Output Format:
Print the answer to each request in one line.

Note:
None
