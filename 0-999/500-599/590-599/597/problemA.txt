Description:
Find the number of k-divisible numbers on the segment [a, b]. In other words you need to find the number of such integer values x that a ≤ x ≤ b and x is divisible by k.

Input Format:
The only line contains three space-separated integers k, a and b (1 ≤ k ≤ 1018; - 1018 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 1018).

Output Format:
Print the required number.
