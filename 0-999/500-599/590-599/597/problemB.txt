Restaurant management can accept and reject orders. What is the maximal number of orders the restaurant can accept?

No two accepted orders can intersect, i.e. they can't share even a moment of time. If one order ends in the moment other starts, they can't be accepted both.

Input Format:
The first line contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105) — number of orders. The following n lines contain integer values li and ri each (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 109).

Output Format:
Print the maximal number of orders that can be accepted.
