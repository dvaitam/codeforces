Description:
As you very well know, this year's funkiest numbers are so called triangular numbers (that is, integers that are representable as $$\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$$, where k is some positive integer), and the coolest numbers are those that are representable as a sum of two triangular numbers.

A well-known hipster Andrew adores everything funky and cool but unfortunately, he isn't good at maths. Given number n, help him define whether this number can be represented by a sum of two triangular numbers (not necessarily different)!

Input Format:
The first input line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 109).

Output Format:
Print "YES" (without the quotes), if n can be represented as a sum of two triangular numbers, otherwise print "NO" (without the quotes).

Note:
In the first sample number $$256 = \frac{2\cdot3}{2} + \frac{22\cdot23}{2}$$.

In the second sample number 512 can not be represented as a sum of two triangular numbers.
