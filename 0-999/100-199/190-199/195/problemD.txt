Description:
As Valeric and Valerko were watching one of the last Euro Championship games in a sports bar, they broke a mug. Of course, the guys paid for it but the barman said that he will let them watch football in his bar only if they help his son complete a programming task. The task goes like that.

Let's consider a set of functions of the following form:

$$y_i(x) = \begin{cases} 
k_i \cdot x + b_i, & \text{if } k_i \cdot x + b_i \geq 0; \\
0, & \text{if } k_i \cdot x + b_i < 0.
\end{cases}$$

Valeric and Valerko really want to watch the next Euro Championship game, so they asked you to help them.

Input Format:
The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of functions. Each of the following n lines contains two space-separated integer numbers ki, bi ( - 109 ≤ ki, bi ≤ 109) that determine the i-th function.

Output Format:
Print a single number — the number of angles that do not equal 180 degrees in the graph of the polyline that equals the sum of the given functions.

Note:
None
