Description:
Today at the lesson Vitya learned a very interesting function — mex. Mex of a sequence of numbers is the minimum non-negative number that is not present in the sequence as element. For example, mex([4, 33, 0, 1, 1, 5]) = 2 and mex([1, 2, 3]) = 0.

Vitya quickly understood all tasks of the teacher, but can you do the same?

You are given an array consisting of n non-negative integers, and m queries. Each query is characterized by one number x and consists of the following consecutive steps:

- Perform the bitwise addition operation modulo 2 (xor) of each array element with the number x.
- Find mex of the resulting array.

Note that after each query the array changes.

Input Format:
First line contains two integer numbers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 3·105) — number of elements in array and number of queries.

Next line contains n integer numbers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 3·105) — elements of then array.

Each of next m lines contains query — one integer number x (0 ≤ x ≤ 3·105).

Output Format:
For each query print the answer on a separate line.

Note:
None
