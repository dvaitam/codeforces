Description:
Arpa is researching the Mexican wave.

There are n spectators in the stadium, labeled from 1 to n. They start the Mexican wave at time 0.

- At time 1, the first spectator stands.
- At time 2, the second spectator stands.
- ...
- At time k, the k-th spectator stands.
- At time k + 1, the (k + 1)-th spectator stands and the first spectator sits.
- At time k + 2, the (k + 2)-th spectator stands and the second spectator sits.
- ...
- At time n, the n-th spectator stands and the (n - k)-th spectator sits.
- At time n + 1, the (n + 1 - k)-th spectator sits.
- ...
- At time n + k, the n-th spectator sits.

Arpa wants to know how many spectators are standing at time t.

Input Format:
The first line contains three integers n, k, t (1 ≤ n ≤ 109, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ t < n + k).

Output Format:
Print single integer: how many spectators are standing at time t.

Note:
In the following a sitting spectator is represented as -, a standing spectator is represented as ^.
