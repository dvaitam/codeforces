Description:
For a given positive integer n denote its k-rounding as the minimum positive integer x, such that x ends with k or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by n.

For example, 4-rounding of 375 is 375·80 = 30000. 30000 is the minimum integer such that it ends with 4 or more zeros and is divisible by 375.

Write a program that will perform the k-rounding of n.

Input Format:
The only line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 109, 0 ≤ k ≤ 8).

Output Format:
Print the k-rounding of n.

Note:
None
