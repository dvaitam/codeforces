Description:
Consider an array A with N elements, all being the same integer a.

Define the product transformation as a simultaneous update Ai = Ai·Ai + 1, that is multiplying each element to the element right to it for $$i \in (1, 2,..., N-1)$$, with the last number AN remaining the same. For example, if we start with an array A with a = 2 and N = 4, then after one product transformation A = [4,  4,  4,  2], and after two product transformations A = [16,  16,  8,  2].

Your simple task is to calculate the array A after M product transformations. Since the numbers can get quite big you should output them modulo Q.

Input Format:
The first and only line of input contains four integers N, M, a, Q (7 ≤ Q ≤ 109 + 123, 2 ≤ a ≤ 106 + 123, $$1 \leq M, N < \phi(a, Q) \leq 10^6 + 123$$, $$\phi(a,Q)$$ is prime), where $$\phi(a,Q)$$ is the multiplicative order of the integer a modulo Q, see notes for definition.

Output Format:
You should output the array A from left to right.

Note:
The multiplicative order of a number a modulo Q $$\phi(a,Q)$$, is the smallest natural number x such that ax mod Q = 1. For example, $$\phi(2,7)=3$$.
