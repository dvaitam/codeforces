Description:
You are given the array of integer numbers a0, a1, ..., an - 1. For each element find the distance to the nearest zero (to the element which equals to zero). There is at least one zero element in the given array.

Input Format:
The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105) — length of the array a. The second line contains integer elements of the array separated by single spaces ( - 109 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

Output Format:
Print the sequence d0, d1, ..., dn - 1, where di is the difference of indices between i and nearest j such that aj = 0. It is possible that i = j.

Note:
None
