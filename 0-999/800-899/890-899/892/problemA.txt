Description:
Jafar has n cans of cola. Each can is described by two integers: remaining volume of cola ai and can's capacity bi (ai  ≤  bi).

Jafar has decided to pour all remaining cola into just 2 cans, determine if he can do this or not!

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — number of cola cans.

The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — volume of remaining cola in cans.

The third line contains n space-separated integers that b1, b2, ..., bn (ai ≤ bi ≤ 109) — capacities of the cans.

Output Format:
Print "YES" (without quotes) if it is possible to pour all remaining cola in 2 cans. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Note:
In the first sample, there are already 2 cans, so the answer is "YES".
