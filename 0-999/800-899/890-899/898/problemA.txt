Description:
Vasya has a non-negative integer n. He wants to round it to nearest integer, which ends up with 0. If n already ends up with 0, Vasya considers it already rounded.

For example, if n = 4722 answer is 4720. If n = 5 Vasya can round it to 0 or to 10. Both ways are correct.

For given n find out to which integer will Vasya round it.

Input Format:
The first line contains single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 109) — number that Vasya has.

Output Format:
Print result of rounding n. Pay attention that in some cases answer isn't unique. In that case print any correct answer.

Note:
In the first example n = 5. Nearest integers, that ends up with zero are 0 and 10. Any of these answers is correct, so you can print 0 or 10.
