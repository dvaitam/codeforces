Description:
Fox Ciel studies number theory.

She thinks a non-empty set S contains non-negative integers is perfect if and only if for any $$a,b\in S$$ (a can be equal to b), $$(a \ xor \ b) \in S$$. Where operation xor means exclusive or operation (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or).

Please calculate the number of perfect sets consisting of integers not greater than k. The answer can be very large, so print it modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 109).

Output Format:
Print a single integer — the number of required sets modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

Note:
In example 1, there are 2 such sets: {0} and {0, 1}. Note that {1} is not a perfect set since 1 xor 1 = 0 and {1} doesn't contain zero.

In example 4, there are 6 such sets: {0}, {0, 1}, {0, 2}, {0, 3}, {0, 4} and {0, 1, 2, 3}.
