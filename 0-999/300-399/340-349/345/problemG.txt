Description:
You are given a group of n strings: s1, s2, ..., sn.

You should find a subgroup si1, si2, ..., sik (1 ≤ i1 < i2 < ... < ik ≤ n) of the group. The following two conditions must hold:

- there exists a string t such, that each string from found subgroup is its suffix;
- the number of strings in the found subgroup is as large as possible.

Your task is to print the number of strings in the found subgroup.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of strings in the group. Each of the next n lines contains a string. The i-th line contains non-empty string si.

Each string consists only from lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all strings si doesn't exceed 105.

Output Format:
Output a single integer — the number of strings in the found subgroup.

Note:
Look at the test sample. The required subgroup is s1, s2, s3.
