Description:
Iahub recently has learned Bubble Sort, an algorithm that is used to sort a permutation with n elements a1, a2, ..., an in ascending order. He is bored of this so simple algorithm, so he invents his own graph. The graph (let's call it G) initially has n vertices and 0 edges. During Bubble Sort execution, edges appear as described in the following algorithm (pseudocode).

For a graph, an independent set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent (so there are no edges between vertices of an independent set). A maximum independent set is an independent set which has maximum cardinality. Given the permutation, find the size of the maximum independent set of graph G, if we use such permutation as the premutation a in procedure bubbleSortGraph.

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105). The next line contains n distinct integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ n).

Output Format:
Output a single integer — the answer to the problem.

Note:
Consider the first example. Bubble sort swaps elements 3 and 1. We add edge (1, 3). Permutation is now [1, 3, 2]. Then bubble sort swaps elements 3 and 2. We add edge (2, 3). Permutation is now sorted. We have a graph with 3 vertices and 2 edges (1, 3) and (2, 3). Its maximal independent set is [1, 2].
