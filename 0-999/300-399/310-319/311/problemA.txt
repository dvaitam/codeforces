Description:
Currently Tiny is learning Computational Geometry. When trying to solve a problem called "The Closest Pair Of Points In The Plane", he found that a code which gave a wrong time complexity got Accepted instead of Time Limit Exceeded.

The problem is the follows. Given n points in the plane, find a pair of points between which the distance is minimized. Distance between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is $$\sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}}$$.

The pseudo code of the unexpected code is as follows:

Here, tot can be regarded as the running time of the code. Due to the fact that a computer can only run a limited number of operations per second, tot should not be more than k in order not to get Time Limit Exceeded.

You are a great hacker. Would you please help Tiny generate a test data and let the code get Time Limit Exceeded?

Input Format:
A single line which contains two space-separated integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 109).

Output Format:
If there doesn't exist such a data which let the given code get TLE, print "no solution" (without quotes); else print n lines, and the i-th line contains two integers xi, yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 109) representing the coordinates of the i-th point.

The conditions below must be held:

- All the points must be distinct.
- |xi|, |yi| ≤ 109.
- After running the given code, the value of tot should be larger than k.

Note:
None
