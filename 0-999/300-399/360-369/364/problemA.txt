Description:
You have a string of decimal digits s. Let's define bij = si·sj. Find in matrix b the number of such rectangles that the sum bij for all cells (i, j) that are the elements of the rectangle equals a in each rectangle.

A rectangle in a matrix is a group of four integers (x, y, z, t) (x ≤ y, z ≤ t). The elements of the rectangle are all cells (i, j) such that x ≤ i ≤ y, z ≤ j ≤ t.

Input Format:
The first line contains integer a (0 ≤ a ≤ 109), the second line contains a string of decimal integers s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 4000).

Output Format:
Print a single integer — the answer to a problem.

Please, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

Note:
None
