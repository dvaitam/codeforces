Description:
Manao is solving a problem with the following statement:

He came up with a solution that produces the correct answers but is too slow. You are given the pseudocode of his solution, where the function getAnswer calculates the answer to the problem:

Your task is to help Manao optimize his algorithm.

Input Format:
The first line contains space-separated integers n, len and h (1 ≤ len ≤ n ≤ 150000; 1 ≤ h ≤ 109). The second line contains len space-separated integers b1, b2, ..., blen (1 ≤ bi ≤ 109). The third line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

Output Format:
Print a single number — the answer to Manao's problem.

Note:
None
