Description:
Yaroslav has an array p = p1, p2, ..., pn (1 ≤ pi ≤ n), consisting of n distinct integers. Also, he has m queries:

- Query number i is represented as a pair of integers li, ri (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n).
- The answer to the query li, ri is the number of pairs of integers q, w (li ≤ q, w ≤ ri) such that pq is the divisor of pw.

Help Yaroslav, answer all his queries.

Input Format:
The first line contains the integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·105). The second line contains n distinct integers p1, p2, ..., pn (1 ≤ pi ≤ n). The following m lines contain Yaroslav's queries. The i-th line contains integers li, ri (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n).

Output Format:
Print m integers — the answers to Yaroslav's queries in the order they appear in the input.

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.
