Description:
Eugeny has array a = a1, a2, ..., an, consisting of n integers. Each integer ai equals to -1, or to 1. Also, he has m queries:

- Query number i is given as a pair of integers li, ri (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n).
- The response to the query will be integer 1, if the elements of array a can be rearranged so as the sum ali + ali + 1 + ... + ari = 0, otherwise the response to the query will be integer 0.

Help Eugeny, answer all his queries.

Input Format:
The first line contains integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·105). The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (ai = -1, 1). Next m lines contain Eugene's queries. The i-th line contains integers li, ri (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n).

Output Format:
Print m integers — the responses to Eugene's queries in the order they occur in the input.

Note:
None
