Description:
You are given an array of integers ai. Find the largest absolute value of difference between adjacent elements of the array max(abs(ai - ai + 1)).

Input Format:
The only line of the input contains a list of space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) — elements of the array. The size of the array is between 2 and 10, inclusive. Note that the size of the array is not given explicitly!

Output Format:
Output a single integer — the largest absolute value of difference between adjacent elements of the array.

Note:
None
