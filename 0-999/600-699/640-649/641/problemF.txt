Description:
Little Artem is a very smart programmer. He knows many different difficult algorithms. Recently he has mastered in 2-SAT one.

In computer science, 2-satisfiability (abbreviated as 2-SAT) is the special case of the problem of determining whether a conjunction (logical AND) of disjunctions (logical OR) have a solution, in which all disjunctions consist of no more than two arguments (variables). For the purpose of this problem we consider only 2-SAT formulas where each disjunction consists of exactly two arguments.

Consider the following 2-SAT problem as an example: $$(!x_{1} \text{ OR } x_{2}) \text{ AND } (x_{3} \text{ OR }!x_{4}) \text{ AND }... \text{ AND } (x_{2n-1} \text{ OR } x_{2n})$$. Note that there might be negations in 2-SAT formula (like for x1 and for x4).

Artem now tries to solve as many problems with 2-SAT as possible. He found a very interesting one, which he can not solve yet. Of course, he asks you to help him.

The problem is: given two 2-SAT formulas f and g, determine whether their sets of possible solutions are the same. Otherwise, find any variables assignment x such that f(x) ≠ g(x).

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains three integers n, m1 and m2 (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m1, m2 ≤ n2) — the number of variables, the number of disjunctions in the first formula and the number of disjunctions in the second formula, respectively.

Next m1 lines contains the description of 2-SAT formula f. The description consists of exactly m1 pairs of integers xi ( - n ≤ xi ≤ n, xi ≠ 0) each on separate line, where xi > 0 corresponds to the variable without negation, while xi < 0 corresponds to the variable with negation. Each pair gives a single disjunction. Next m2 lines contains formula g in the similar format.

Output Format:
If both formulas share the same set of solutions, output a single word "SIMILAR" (without quotes). Otherwise output exactly n integers xi ($$x_i \in \{0, 1\}$$) — any set of values x such that f(x) ≠ g(x).

Note:
First sample has two equal formulas, so they are similar by definition.

In second sample if we compute first function with x1 = 0 and x2 = 0 we get the result 0, because $$( 0 \; \textcircled { O R } \; 0 ) = 0$$. But the second formula is 1, because $$( 0 \; { \mathrm { O R } } \;! 0 ) = ( 0 \; { \mathrm { O R } } \; 1 ) = 1$$.
