Description:
You are given n segments on a line. There are no ends of some segments that coincide. For each segment find the number of segments it contains.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105) — the number of segments on a line.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers li and ri ( - 109 ≤ li < ri ≤ 109) — the coordinates of the left and the right ends of the i-th segment. It is guaranteed that there are no ends of some segments that coincide.

Output Format:
Print n lines. The j-th of them should contain the only integer aj — the number of segments contained in the j-th segment.

Note:
None
