Description:
Yash has recently learnt about the Fibonacci sequence and is very excited about it. He calls a sequence Fibonacci-ish if

1. the sequence consists of at least two elements
2. f0 and f1 are arbitrary
3. fn + 2 = fn + 1 + fn for all n ≥ 0.

You are given some sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an. Your task is rearrange elements of this sequence in such a way that its longest possible prefix is Fibonacci-ish sequence.

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the length of the sequence ai.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (|ai| ≤ 109).

Output Format:
Print the length of the longest possible Fibonacci-ish prefix of the given sequence after rearrangement.

Note:
In the first sample, if we rearrange elements of the sequence as  - 1, 2, 1, the whole sequence ai would be Fibonacci-ish.

In the second sample, the optimal way to rearrange elements is $$7$$, $$14$$, $$21$$, $$35$$, 28.
