Description:
You are given array a with n elements and the number m. Consider some subsequence of a and the value of least common multiple (LCM) of its elements. Denote LCM as l. Find any longest subsequence of a with the value l ≤ m.

A subsequence of a is an array we can get by erasing some elements of a. It is allowed to erase zero or all elements.

The LCM of an empty array equals 1.

Input Format:
The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 106) — the size of the array a and the parameter from the problem statement.

The second line contains n integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — the elements of a.

Output Format:
In the first line print two integers l and kmax (1 ≤ l ≤ m, 0 ≤ kmax ≤ n) — the value of LCM and the number of elements in optimal subsequence.

In the second line print kmax integers — the positions of the elements from the optimal subsequence in the ascending order.

Note that you can find and print any subsequence with the maximum length.

Note:
None
