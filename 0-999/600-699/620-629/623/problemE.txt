Description:
Let's define the transformation P of a sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an as b1, b2, ..., bn, where bi = a1 | a2 | ... | ai for all i = 1, 2, ..., n, where | is the bitwise OR operation.

Vasya consequently applies the transformation P to all sequences of length n consisting of integers from 1 to 2k - 1 inclusive. He wants to know how many of these sequences have such property that their transformation is a strictly increasing sequence. Help him to calculate this number modulo 109 + 7.

Input Format:
The only line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 1018, 1 ≤ k ≤ 30 000).

Output Format:
Print a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 109 + 7.

Note:
None
