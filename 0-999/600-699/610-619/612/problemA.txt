Description:
You are given the string s of length n and the numbers p, q. Split the string s to pieces of length p and q.

For example, the string "Hello" for p = 2, q = 3 can be split to the two strings "Hel" and "lo" or to the two strings "He" and "llo".

Note it is allowed to split the string s to the strings only of length p or to the strings only of length q (see the second sample test).

Input Format:
The first line contains three positive integers n, p, q (1 ≤ p, q ≤ n ≤ 100).

The second line contains the string s consists of lowercase and uppercase latin letters and digits.

Output Format:
If it's impossible to split the string s to the strings of length p and q print the only number "-1".

Otherwise in the first line print integer k — the number of strings in partition of s.

Each of the next k lines should contain the strings in partition. Each string should be of the length p or q. The string should be in order of their appearing in string s — from left to right.

If there are several solutions print any of them.

Note:
None
