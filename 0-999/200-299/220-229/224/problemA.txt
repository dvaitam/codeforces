Description:
You've got a rectangular parallelepiped with integer edge lengths. You know the areas of its three faces that have a common vertex. Your task is to find the sum of lengths of all 12 edges of this parallelepiped.

Input Format:
The first and the single line contains three space-separated integers — the areas of the parallelepiped's faces. The area's values are positive ( > 0) and do not exceed 104. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one parallelepiped that satisfies the problem statement.

Output Format:
Print a single number — the sum of all edges of the parallelepiped.

Note:
In the first sample the parallelepiped has sizes 1 × 1 × 1, in the second one — 2 × 2 × 3.
