Description:
Consider the following equation:

$$z = \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor + y + xy$$

Let's find all integer z (z > 0), for which this equation is unsolvable in positive integers. The phrase "unsolvable in positive integers" means that there are no such positive integers x and y (x, y > 0), for which the given above equation holds.

Let's write out all such z in the increasing order: z1, z2, z3, and so on (zi < zi + 1). Your task is: given the number n, find the number zn.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 40).

Output Format:
Print a single integer — the number zn modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7). It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Note:
None
