Description:
You've got a string s = s1s2... s|s| of length |s|, consisting of lowercase English letters. There also are q queries, each query is described by two integers li, ri (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ |s|). The answer to the query is the number of substrings of string s[li... ri], which are palindromes.

String s[l... r] = slsl + 1... sr (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ |s|) is a substring of string s = s1s2... s|s|.

String t is called a palindrome, if it reads the same from left to right and from right to left. Formally, if t = t1t2... t|t| = t|t|t|t| - 1... t1.

Input Format:
The first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000). The second line contains a single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 106) — the number of queries. Next q lines contain the queries. The i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers li, ri (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ |s|) — the description of the i-th query.

It is guaranteed that the given string consists only of lowercase English letters.

Output Format:
Print q integers — the answers to the queries. Print the answers in the order, in which the queries are given in the input. Separate the printed numbers by whitespaces.

Note:
Consider the fourth query in the first test case. String s[4... 6] = «aba». Its palindrome substrings are: «a», «b», «a», «aba».
