Description:
Little boy Valera studies an algorithm of sorting an integer array. After studying the theory, he went on to the practical tasks. As a result, he wrote a program that sorts an array of n integers a1, a2, ..., an in the non-decreasing order. The pseudocode of the program, written by Valera, is given below. The input of the program gets number n and array a.

But Valera could have made a mistake, because he hasn't yet fully learned the sorting algorithm. If Valera made a mistake in his program, you need to give a counter-example that makes his program work improperly (that is, the example that makes the program sort the array not in the non-decreasing order). If such example for the given value of n doesn't exist, print -1.

Input Format:
You've got a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the size of the sorted array.

Output Format:
Print n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) — the counter-example, for which Valera's algorithm won't work correctly. If the counter-example that meets the described conditions is impossible to give, print -1.

If there are several counter-examples, consisting of n numbers, you are allowed to print any of them.

Note:
None
