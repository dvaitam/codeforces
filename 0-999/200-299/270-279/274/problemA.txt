Description:
A k-multiple free set is a set of integers where there is no pair of integers where one is equal to another integer multiplied by k. That is, there are no two integers x and y (x < y) from the set, such that y = x·k.

You're given a set of n distinct positive integers. Your task is to find the size of it's largest k-multiple free subset.

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ k ≤ 109). The next line contains a list of n distinct positive integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

All the numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.

Output Format:
On the only line of the output print the size of the largest k-multiple free subset of {a1, a2, ..., an}.

Note:
In the sample input one of the possible maximum 2-multiple free subsets is {4, 5, 6}.
