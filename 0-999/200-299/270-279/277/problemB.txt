Description:
Convexity of a set of points on the plane is the size of the largest subset of points that form a convex polygon. Your task is to build a set of n points with the convexity of exactly m. Your set of points should not contain three points that lie on a straight line.

Input Format:
The single line contains two integers n and m (3 ≤ m ≤ 100, m ≤ n ≤ 2m).

Output Format:
If there is no solution, print "-1". Otherwise, print n pairs of integers — the coordinates of points of any set with the convexity of m. The coordinates shouldn't exceed 108 in their absolute value.

Note:
None
