Description:
You are given three positive integers x, y, n. Your task is to find the nearest fraction to fraction $$\frac{x}{y}$$ whose denominator is no more than n.

Formally, you should find such pair of integers a, b (1 ≤ b ≤ n; 0 ≤ a) that the value $$\left|\frac{x}{y}-\frac{a}{b}\right|$$ is as minimal as possible.

If there are multiple "nearest" fractions, choose the one with the minimum denominator. If there are multiple "nearest" fractions with the minimum denominator, choose the one with the minimum numerator.

Input Format:
A single line contains three integers x, y, n (1 ≤ x, y, n ≤ 105).

Output Format:
Print the required fraction in the format "a/b" (without quotes).

Note:
None
