Description:
You are given a permutation of integers from 1 to n. Exactly once you apply the following operation to this permutation: pick a random segment and shuffle its elements. Formally:

1. Pick a random segment (continuous subsequence) from l to r. All $$\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$ segments are equiprobable.
2. Let k = r - l + 1, i.e. the length of the chosen segment. Pick a random permutation of integers from 1 to k, p1, p2, ..., pk. All k! permutation are equiprobable.
3. This permutation is applied to elements of the chosen segment, i.e. permutation a1, a2, ..., al - 1, al, al + 1, ..., ar - 1, ar, ar + 1, ..., an is transformed to a1, a2, ..., al - 1, al - 1 + p1, al - 1 + p2, ..., al - 1 + pk - 1, al - 1 + pk, ar + 1, ..., an.

Inversion if a pair of elements (not necessary neighbouring) with the wrong relative order. In other words, the number of inversion is equal to the number of pairs (i, j) such that i < j and ai > aj. Find the expected number of inversions after we apply exactly one operation mentioned above.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the length of the permutation.

The second line contains n distinct integers from 1 to n — elements of the permutation.

Output Format:
Print one real value — the expected number of inversions. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 9.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $${ \frac { | a - b | } { \operatorname* { m a x } ( 1, b ) } } \leq 1 0 ^ { - 9 }$$.
