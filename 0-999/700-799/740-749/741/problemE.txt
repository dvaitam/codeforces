Description:
All of us know that girls in Arpa’s land are... ok, you’ve got the idea :D

Anyone knows that Arpa isn't a normal man, he is ... well, sorry, I can't explain it more. Mehrdad is interested about the reason, so he asked Sipa, one of the best biology scientists in Arpa's land, for help. Sipa has a DNA editor.

Sipa put Arpa under the DNA editor. DNA editor showed Arpa's DNA as a string S consisting of n lowercase English letters. Also Sipa has another DNA T consisting of lowercase English letters that belongs to a normal man.

Now there are (n + 1) options to change Arpa's DNA, numbered from 0 to n. i-th of them is to put T between i-th and (i + 1)-th characters of S (0 ≤ i ≤ n). If i = 0, T will be put before S, and if i = n, it will be put after S.

Mehrdad wants to choose the most interesting option for Arpa's DNA among these n + 1 options. DNA A is more interesting than B if A is lexicographically smaller than B. Mehrdad asked Sipa q questions:

Given integers l, r, k, x, y, what is the most interesting option if we only consider such options i that l ≤ i ≤ r and $$x \leq (i \bmod k) \leq y$$? If there are several most interesting options, Mehrdad wants to know one with the smallest number i.

Since Sipa is a biology scientist but not a programmer, you should help him.

Input Format:
The first line contains strings S, T and integer q (1 ≤ |S|, |T|, q ≤ 105) — Arpa's DNA, the DNA of a normal man, and the number of Mehrdad's questions. The strings S and T consist only of small English letters.

Next q lines describe the Mehrdad's questions. Each of these lines contain five integers l, r, k, x, y (0 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, 0 ≤ x ≤ y < k).

Output Format:
Print q integers. The j-th of them should be the number i of the most interesting option among those that satisfy the conditions of the j-th question. If there is no option i satisfying the conditions in some question, print -1.

Note:
Explanation of first sample case:

In the first question Sipa has two options: dabc (i = 0) and abdc (i = 2). The latter (abcd) is better than abdc, so answer is 2.

In the last question there is no i such that 0 ≤ i ≤ 1 and $$2 \leq ( i \bmod 3 ) \leq 2$$.
