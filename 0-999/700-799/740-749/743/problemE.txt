Description:
Vladik was bored on his way home and decided to play the following game. He took n cards and put them in a row in front of himself. Every card has a positive integer number not exceeding 8 written on it. He decided to find the longest subsequence of cards which satisfies the following conditions:

- the number of occurrences of each number from 1 to 8 in the subsequence doesn't differ by more then 1 from the number of occurrences of any other number. Formally, if there are ck cards with number k on them in the subsequence, than for all pairs of integers $$i \in [1,8], j \in [1,8]$$ the condition |ci - cj| ≤ 1 must hold.
- if there is at least one card with number x on it in the subsequence, then all cards with number x in this subsequence must form a continuous segment in it (but not necessarily a continuous segment in the original sequence). For example, the subsequence [1, 1, 2, 2] satisfies this condition while the subsequence [1, 2, 2, 1] doesn't. Note that [1, 1, 2, 2] doesn't satisfy the first condition.

Please help Vladik to find the length of the longest subsequence that satisfies both conditions.

Input Format:
The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of cards in Vladik's sequence.

The second line contains the sequence of n positive integers not exceeding 8 — the description of Vladik's sequence.

Output Format:
Print single integer — the length of the longest subsequence of Vladik's sequence that satisfies both conditions.

Note:
In the first sample all the numbers written on the cards are equal, so you can't take more than one card, otherwise you'll violate the first condition.
