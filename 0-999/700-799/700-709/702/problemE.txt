Description:
You are given a functional graph. It is a directed graph, in which from each vertex goes exactly one arc. The vertices are numerated from 0 to n - 1.

Graph is given as the array f0, f1, ..., fn - 1, where fi — the number of vertex to which goes the only arc from the vertex i. Besides you are given array with weights of the arcs w0, w1, ..., wn - 1, where wi — the arc weight from i to fi.

The graph from the first sample test.

Also you are given the integer k (the length of the path) and you need to find for each vertex two numbers si and mi, where:

- si — the sum of the weights of all arcs of the path with length equals to k which starts from the vertex i;
- mi — the minimal weight from all arcs on the path with length k which starts from the vertex i.

The length of the path is the number of arcs on this path.

Input Format:
The first line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ k ≤ 1010). The second line contains the sequence f0, f1, ..., fn - 1 (0 ≤ fi < n) and the third — the sequence w0, w1, ..., wn - 1 (0 ≤ wi ≤ 108).

Output Format:
Print n lines, the pair of integers si, mi in each line.

Note:
