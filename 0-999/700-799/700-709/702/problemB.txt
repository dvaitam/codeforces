Description:
You are given n integers a1, a2, ..., an. Find the number of pairs of indexes i, j (i < j) that ai + aj is a power of 2 (i. e. some integer x exists so that ai + aj = 2x).

Input Format:
The first line contains the single positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of integers.

The second line contains n positive integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

Output Format:
Print the number of pairs of indexes i, j (i < j) that ai + aj is a power of 2.

Note:
In the first example the following pairs of indexes include in answer: (1, 4) and (2, 4).

In the second example all pairs of indexes (i, j) (where i < j) include in answer.
