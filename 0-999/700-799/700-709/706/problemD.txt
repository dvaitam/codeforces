Description:
Author has gone out of the stories about Vasiliy, so here is just a formal task description.

You are given q queries and a multiset A, initially containing only integer 0. There are three types of queries:

1. "+ x" — add integer x to multiset A.
2. "- x" — erase one occurrence of integer x from multiset A. It's guaranteed that at least one x is present in the multiset A before this query.
3. "? x" — you are given integer x and need to compute the value $$\max_{y \in A} (x \oplus y)$$, i.e. the maximum value of bitwise exclusive OR (also know as XOR) of integer x and some integer y from the multiset A.

Multiset is a set, where equal elements are allowed.

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains a single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 200 000) — the number of queries Vasiliy has to perform.

Each of the following q lines of the input contains one of three characters '+', '-' or '?' and an integer xi (1 ≤ xi ≤ 109). It's guaranteed that there is at least one query of the third type.

Note, that the integer 0 will always be present in the set A.

Output Format:
For each query of the type '?' print one integer — the maximum value of bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) of integer xi and some integer from the multiset A.

Note:
After first five operations multiset A contains integers 0, 8, 9, 11, 6 and 1.

The answer for the sixth query is integer $$1 1 = 3 \oplus 8$$ — maximum among integers $$3 \oplus 0 = 3$$, $$3 \oplus 9 = 10$$, $$3 \oplus 11 = 8$$, $$3 \oplus 6 = 5$$ and $$3 \oplus 1 = 2$$.
