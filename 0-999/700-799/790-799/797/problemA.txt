Description:
Given a positive integer n, find k integers (not necessary distinct) such that all these integers are strictly greater than 1, and their product is equal to n.

Input Format:
The first line contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 20).

Output Format:
If it's impossible to find the representation of n as a product of k numbers, print -1.

Otherwise, print k integers in any order. Their product must be equal to n. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Note:
None
