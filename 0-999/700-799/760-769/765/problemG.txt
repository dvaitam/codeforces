Description:
If you have gone that far, you'll probably skip unnecessary legends anyway...

You are given a binary string $$s = s_0 \ldots s_{m-1}$$ and an integer $$N = p_{1}^{\alpha_{1}} \ldots p_{n}^{\alpha_{n}}$$. Find the number of integers k, 0 ≤ k < N, such that for all i = 0, 1, ..., m - 1

$$\gcd(k+i,N)=1 \text{ if and only if } s_i=1$$

Input Format:
In the first line of input there is a string s consisting of 0's and 1's (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 40).

In the next line of input there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105).

Each of the next n lines contains two space-separated integers pi, αi (1 ≤ pi, αi ≤ 109, pi is prime). All pi are distinct.

Output Format:
A single integer — the answer to the problem.

Note:
None
