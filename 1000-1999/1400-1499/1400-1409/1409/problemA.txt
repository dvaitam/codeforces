Description:
You are given two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$.

In one move, you can choose some integer $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$10$$$ and add it to $$$a$$$ or subtract it from $$$a$$$. In other words, you choose an integer $$$k \in [1; 10]$$$ and perform $$$a := a + k$$$ or $$$a := a - k$$$. You may use different values of $$$k$$$ in different moves.

Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain $$$b$$$ from $$$a$$$.

You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b \le 10^9$$$).

Output Format:
For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of moves required to obtain $$$b$$$ from $$$a$$$.

Note:
In the first test case of the example, you don't need to do anything.

In the second test case of the example, the following sequence of moves can be applied: $$$13 \rightarrow 23 \rightarrow 32 \rightarrow 42$$$ (add $$$10$$$, add $$$9$$$, add $$$10$$$).

In the third test case of the example, the following sequence of moves can be applied: $$$18 \rightarrow 10 \rightarrow 4$$$ (subtract $$$8$$$, subtract $$$6$$$).
