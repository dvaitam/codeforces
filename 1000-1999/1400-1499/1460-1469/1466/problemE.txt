Description:
Only a few know that Pan and Apollo weren't only battling for the title of the GOAT musician. A few millenniums later, they also challenged each other in math (or rather in fast calculations). The task they got to solve is the following:

Let $$$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$$$ be the sequence of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers. Find this value: $$$$$$\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^n (x_i \, \& \, x_j) \cdot (x_j \, | \, x_k)$$$$$$

Here $$$\&$$$ denotes the bitwise and, and $$$|$$$ denotes the bitwise or.

Pan and Apollo could solve this in a few seconds. Can you do it too? For convenience, find the answer modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1\,000$$$) denoting the number of test cases, then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.

The first line of each test case consists of a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 5 \cdot 10^5$$$), the length of the sequence. The second one contains $$$n$$$ non-negative integers $$$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$$$ ($$$0 \leq x_i < 2^{60}$$$), elements of the sequence.

The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases will not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^5$$$.

Output Format:
Print $$$t$$$ lines. The $$$i$$$-th line should contain the answer to the $$$i$$$-th text case.

Note:
None
