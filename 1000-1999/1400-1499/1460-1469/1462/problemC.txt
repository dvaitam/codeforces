Description:
You are given a positive number $$$x$$$. Find the smallest positive integer number that has the sum of digits equal to $$$x$$$ and all digits are distinct (unique).

Input Format:
The first line contains a single positive integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 50$$$) — the number of test cases in the test. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.

Each test case consists of a single integer number $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le x \le 50$$$).

Output Format:
Output $$$t$$$ answers to the test cases:

- if a positive integer number with the sum of digits equal to $$$x$$$ and all digits are different exists, print the smallest such number;
- otherwise print -1.

Note:
None
