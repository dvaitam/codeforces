Description:
In Bubbleland a group of special programming forces gets a top secret job to calculate the number of potentially infected people by a new unknown virus. The state has a population of $$$n$$$ people and every day there is new information about new contacts between people. The job of special programming forces is to calculate how many contacts in the last $$$k$$$ days a given person had.

The new virus has an incubation period of $$$k$$$ days, and after that time people consider as non-infectious. Because the new virus is an extremely dangerous, government mark as suspicious everybody who had direct or indirect contact in the last $$$k$$$ days, independently of the order of contacts.

This virus is very strange, and people can't get durable immunity.

You need to help special programming forces to calculate the number of suspicious people for a given person (number of people who had contact with a given person).

There are 3 given inputs on beginning $$$n$$$ where $$$n$$$ is population, $$$q$$$ number of queries, $$$k$$$ virus incubation time in days. Each query is one of three types:

1. ($$$x$$$, $$$y$$$) person $$$x$$$ and person $$$y$$$ met that day ($$$x \neq y$$$).
2. ($$$z$$$) return the number of people in contact with $$$z$$$, counting himself.
3. The end of the current day moves on to the next day.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n\le 10^5$$$) the number of people in the state, $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q\le 5Ã—10^5$$$) number of queries and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k\le 10^5$$$) virus incubation time in days.

Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines starts with an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t\le 3$$$) the type of the query.

A pair of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \le x, y \le n$$$) follows in the query of the first type ($$$x \neq y$$$).

An integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i\le n$$$) follows in the query of the second type.

Query of third type does not have the following number.

Output Format:
For the queries of the second type print on a separate line the current number of people in contact with a given person.

Note:
Pay attention if persons $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ had contact first day and next day persons $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$ had contact, for $$$k$$$>$$$1$$$ number of contacts of person $$$3$$$ is $$$3$$$(persons:1,2,3).
