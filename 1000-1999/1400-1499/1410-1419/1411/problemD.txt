Description:
Currently, XXOC's rap is a string consisting of zeroes, ones, and question marks. Unfortunately, haters gonna hate. They will write $$$x$$$ angry comments for every occurrence of subsequence 01 and $$$y$$$ angry comments for every occurrence of subsequence 10. You should replace all the question marks with 0 or 1 in such a way that the number of angry comments would be as small as possible.

String $$$b$$$ is a subsequence of string $$$a$$$, if it can be obtained by removing some characters from $$$a$$$. Two occurrences of a subsequence are considered distinct if sets of positions of remaining characters are distinct.

Input Format:
The first line contains string $$$s$$$ — XXOC's rap ($$$1 \le |s| \leq 10^5$$$). The second line contains two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ — the number of angry comments XXOC will recieve for every occurrence of 01 and 10 accordingly ($$$0 \leq x, y \leq 10^6$$$).

Output Format:
Output a single integer — the minimum number of angry comments.

Note:
In the first example one of the optimum ways to replace is 001. Then there will be $$$2$$$ subsequences 01 and $$$0$$$ subsequences 10. Total number of angry comments will be equal to $$$2 \cdot 2 + 0 \cdot 3 = 4$$$.

In the second example one of the optimum ways to replace is 11111. Then there will be $$$0$$$ subsequences 01 and $$$0$$$ subsequences 10. Total number of angry comments will be equal to $$$0 \cdot 13 + 0 \cdot 37 = 0$$$.

In the third example one of the optimum ways to replace is 1100. Then there will be $$$0$$$ subsequences 01 and $$$4$$$ subsequences 10. Total number of angry comments will be equal to $$$0 \cdot 239 + 4 \cdot 7 = 28$$$.

In the fourth example one of the optimum ways to replace is 01101001. Then there will be $$$8$$$ subsequences 01 and $$$8$$$ subsequences 10. Total number of angry comments will be equal to $$$8 \cdot 5 + 8 \cdot 7 = 96$$$.
