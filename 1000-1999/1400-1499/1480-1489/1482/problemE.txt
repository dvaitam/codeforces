Description:
Alice is visiting New York City. To make the trip fun, Alice will take photos of the city skyline and give the set of photos as a present to Bob. However, she wants to find the set of photos with maximum beauty and she needs your help.

There are $$$n$$$ buildings in the city, the $$$i$$$-th of them has positive height $$$h_i$$$. All $$$n$$$ building heights in the city are different. In addition, each building has a beauty value $$$b_i$$$. Note that beauty can be positive or negative, as there are ugly buildings in the city too.

A set of photos consists of one or more photos of the buildings in the skyline. Each photo includes one or more buildings in the skyline that form a contiguous segment of indices. Each building needs to be in exactly one photo. This means that if a building does not appear in any photo, or if a building appears in more than one photo, the set of pictures is not valid.

The beauty of a photo is equivalent to the beauty $$$b_i$$$ of the shortest building in it. The total beauty of a set of photos is the sum of the beauty of all photos in it. Help Alice to find the maximum beauty a valid set of photos can have.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$), the number of buildings on the skyline.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_n$$$ ($$$1 \le h_i \le n$$$). The $$$i$$$-th number represents the height of building $$$i$$$.

The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le b_i \le 10^9$$$). The $$$i$$$-th number represents the beauty of building $$$i$$$.

Output Format:
Print one number representing the maximum beauty Alice can achieve for a valid set of photos of the skyline.

Note:
In the first example, Alice can achieve maximum beauty by taking five photos, each one containing one building.

In the second example, Alice can achieve a maximum beauty of $$$10$$$ by taking four pictures: three just containing one building, on buildings $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$5$$$, each photo with beauty $$$-3$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$7$$$ respectively, and another photo containing building $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$, with beauty $$$2$$$.

In the third example, Alice will just take one picture of the whole city.

In the fourth example, Alice can take the following pictures to achieve maximum beauty: photos with just one building on buildings $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$8$$$, $$$9$$$, and $$$10$$$, and a single photo of buildings $$$3$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$5$$$, $$$6$$$, and $$$7$$$.
