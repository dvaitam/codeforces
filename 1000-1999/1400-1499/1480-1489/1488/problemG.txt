Description:
You are given $$$n$$$ integers, each integer is from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, all of them are pairwise distinct. You have to paint them red and blue (each integer should have exactly one color).

The cost of painting is the number of pairs $$$(x, y)$$$ such that $$$y \bmod x = 0$$$, $$$y$$$ is red and $$$x$$$ is blue.

For each $$$k \in [1, n]$$$, calculate the maximum cost of painting if exactly $$$k$$$ integers should have a red color.

Input Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5$$$).

Output Format:
For each $$$k \in [1,n]$$$ print one integer â€” the maximum cost of painting, if exactly $$$k$$$ integers should be red.

Note:
None
