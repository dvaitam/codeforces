Description:
A pair of positive integers $$$(a,b)$$$ is called special if $$$\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \rfloor = a \bmod b$$$. Here, $$$\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \rfloor$$$ is the result of the integer division between $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, while $$$a \bmod b$$$ is its remainder.

You are given two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. Find the number of special pairs $$$(a,b)$$$ such that $$$1\leq a \leq x$$$ and $$$1 \leq b \leq y$$$.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) â€” the number of test cases.

The only line of the description of each test case contains two integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \le x,y \le 10^9$$$).

Output Format:
For each test case print the answer on a single line.

Note:
In the first test case, the only special pair is $$$(3, 2)$$$.

In the second test case, there are no special pairs.

In the third test case, there are two special pairs: $$$(3, 2)$$$ and $$$(4, 3)$$$.
