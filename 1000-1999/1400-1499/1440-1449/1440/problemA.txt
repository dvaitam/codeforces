Description:
You are given four integers $$$n$$$, $$$c_0$$$, $$$c_1$$$ and $$$h$$$ and a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$.

A binary string is a string consisting of characters $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$.

You can change any character of the string $$$s$$$ (the string should be still binary after the change). You should pay $$$h$$$ coins for each change.

After some changes (possibly zero) you want to buy the string. To buy the string you should buy all its characters. To buy the character $$$0$$$ you should pay $$$c_0$$$ coins, to buy the character $$$1$$$ you should pay $$$c_1$$$ coins.

Find the minimum number of coins needed to buy the string.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10$$$) — the number of test cases. Next $$$2t$$$ lines contain descriptions of test cases.

The first line of the description of each test case contains four integers $$$n$$$, $$$c_{0}$$$, $$$c_{1}$$$, $$$h$$$ ($$$1 \leq n, c_{0}, c_{1}, h \leq 1000$$$).

The second line of the description of each test case contains the binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$.

Output Format:
For each test case print a single integer — the minimum number of coins needed to buy the string.

Note:
In the first test case, you can buy all characters and pay $$$3$$$ coins, because both characters $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ costs $$$1$$$ coin.

In the second test case, you can firstly change $$$2$$$-nd and $$$4$$$-th symbols of the string from $$$1$$$ to $$$0$$$ and pay $$$2$$$ coins for that. Your string will be $$$00000$$$. After that, you can buy the string and pay $$$5 \cdot 10 = 50$$$ coins for that. The total number of coins paid will be $$$2 + 50 = 52$$$.
