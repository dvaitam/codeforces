Description:
$$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$$$ are written on the board. Nezzar can perform the following operation multiple times.

- Select two integers $$$x,y$$$ (not necessarily distinct) on the board, and write down $$$2x-y$$$. Note that you don't remove selected numbers.

Now, Nezzar wonders if it is possible to have his favorite number $$$k$$$ on the board after applying above operation multiple times.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$) â€” the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n,k$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$-10^{18} \le k \le 10^{18}$$$).

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$$$ ($$$-10^{18} \le x_i \le 10^{18}$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

Output Format:
For each test case, print "YES" on a single line if it is possible to have $$$k$$$ on the board. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Note:
In the first test case, the number $$$1$$$ is already on the board.

In the second test case, Nezzar could perform the following operations to write down $$$k=0$$$ on the board:

- Select $$$x=3$$$ and $$$y=2$$$ and write down $$$4$$$ on the board.
- Select $$$x=4$$$ and $$$y=7$$$ and write down $$$1$$$ on the board.
- Select $$$x=1$$$ and $$$y=2$$$ and write down $$$0$$$ on the board.

In the third test case, it is impossible to have the number $$$k = -1$$$ on the board.
