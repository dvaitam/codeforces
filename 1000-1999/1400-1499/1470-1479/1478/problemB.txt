Description:
Nezzar's favorite digit among $$$1,\ldots,9$$$ is $$$d$$$. He calls a positive integer lucky if $$$d$$$ occurs at least once in its decimal representation.

Given $$$q$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_q$$$, for each $$$1 \le i \le q$$$ Nezzar would like to know if $$$a_i$$$ can be equal to a sum of several (one or more) lucky numbers.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 9$$$) â€” the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$q$$$ and $$$d$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 10^4$$$, $$$1 \le d \le 9$$$).

The second line of each test case contains $$$q$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_q$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).

Output Format:
For each integer in each test case, print "YES" in a single line if $$$a_i$$$ can be equal to a sum of lucky numbers. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print letters in any case (upper or lower).

Note:
In the first test case, $$$24 = 17 + 7$$$, $$$27$$$ itself is a lucky number, $$$25$$$ cannot be equal to a sum of lucky numbers.
