Description:
You have an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct positive integers, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Define $$$p_k$$$ as $$$$$$p_k = \sum_{1 \le i, j \le k} a_i \bmod a_j,$$$$$$ where $$$x \bmod y$$$ denotes the remainder when $$$x$$$ is divided by $$$y$$$. You have to find and print $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$.

Input Format:
The first line contains $$$n$$$ â€” the length of the array ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).

The second line contains $$$n$$$ space-separated distinct integers $$$a_1, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$a_i \neq a_j$$$ if $$$i \neq j$$$).

Output Format:
Print $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$.

Note:
