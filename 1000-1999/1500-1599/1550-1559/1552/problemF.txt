Description:
An ant moves on the real line with constant speed of $$$1$$$ unit per second. It starts at $$$0$$$ and always moves to the right (so its position increases by $$$1$$$ each second).

There are $$$n$$$ portals, the $$$i$$$-th of which is located at position $$$x_i$$$ and teleports to position $$$y_i < x_i$$$. Each portal can be either active or inactive. The initial state of the $$$i$$$-th portal is determined by $$$s_i$$$: if $$$s_i=0$$$ then the $$$i$$$-th portal is initially inactive, if $$$s_i=1$$$ then the $$$i$$$-th portal is initially active. When the ant travels through a portal (i.e., when its position coincides with the position of a portal):

- if the portal is inactive, it becomes active (in this case the path of the ant is not affected);
- if the portal is active, it becomes inactive and the ant is instantly teleported to the position $$$y_i$$$, where it keeps on moving as normal.

How long (from the instant it starts moving) does it take for the ant to reach the position $$$x_n + 1$$$? It can be shown that this happens in a finite amount of time. Since the answer may be very large, compute it modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Input Format:
The first line contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of portals.

The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains three integers $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$ and $$$s_i$$$ ($$$1\le y_i < x_i\le 10^9$$$, $$$s_i\in\{0,1\}$$$) — the position of the $$$i$$$-th portal, the position where the ant is teleported when it travels through the $$$i$$$-th portal (if it is active), and the initial state of the $$$i$$$-th portal.

The positions of the portals are strictly increasing, that is $$$x_1<x_2<\cdots<x_n$$$. It is guaranteed that the $$$2n$$$ integers $$$x_1, \, x_2, \, \dots, \, x_n, \, y_1, \, y_2, \, \dots, \, y_n$$$ are all distinct.

Output Format:
Output the amount of time elapsed, in seconds, from the instant the ant starts moving to the instant it reaches the position $$$x_n+1$$$. Since the answer may be very large, output it modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Note:
Explanation of the first sample: The ant moves as follows (a curvy arrow denotes a teleporting, a straight arrow denotes normal movement with speed $$$1$$$ and the time spent during the movement is written above the arrow). $$$$$$ 0 \stackrel{6}{\longrightarrow} 6 \leadsto 5 \stackrel{3}{\longrightarrow} 8 \leadsto 1 \stackrel{2}{\longrightarrow} 3 \leadsto 2 \stackrel{4}{\longrightarrow} 6 \leadsto 5 \stackrel{2}{\longrightarrow} 7 \leadsto 4 \stackrel{2}{\longrightarrow} 6 \leadsto 5 \stackrel{4}{\longrightarrow} 9 $$$$$$ Notice that the total time is $$$6+3+2+4+2+2+4=23$$$.

Explanation of the second sample: The ant moves as follows (a curvy arrow denotes a teleporting, a straight arrow denotes normal movement with speed $$$1$$$ and the time spent during the movement is written above the arrow). $$$$$$ 0 \stackrel{454971987}{\longrightarrow} 454971987 \leadsto 406874902 \stackrel{48097086}{\longrightarrow} 454971988 $$$$$$ Notice that the total time is $$$454971987+48097086=503069073$$$.

Explanation of the third sample: Since all portals are initially off, the ant will not be teleported and will go straight from $$$0$$$ to $$$x_n+1=899754846+1=899754847$$$.
