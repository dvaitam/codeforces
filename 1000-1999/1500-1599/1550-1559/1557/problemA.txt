Description:
Ezzat has an array of $$$n$$$ integers (maybe negative). He wants to split it into two non-empty subsequences $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, such that every element from the array belongs to exactly one subsequence, and the value of $$$f(a) + f(b)$$$ is the maximum possible value, where $$$f(x)$$$ is the average of the subsequence $$$x$$$.

A sequence $$$x$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$y$$$ if $$$x$$$ can be obtained from $$$y$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

The average of a subsequence is the sum of the numbers of this subsequence divided by the size of the subsequence.

For example, the average of $$$[1,5,6]$$$ is $$$(1+5+6)/3 = 12/3 = 4$$$, so $$$f([1,5,6]) = 4$$$.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^3$$$)— the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines.

The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 10^5$$$).

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3\cdot10^5$$$.

Output Format:
For each test case, print a single value — the maximum value that Ezzat can achieve.

Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $$$10^{-6}$$$.

Formally, let your answer be $$$a$$$, and the jury's answer be $$$b$$$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $$$\frac{|a - b|}{\max{(1, |b|)}} \le 10^{-6}$$$.

Note:
In the first test case, the array is $$$[3, 1, 2]$$$. These are all the possible ways to split this array:

- $$$a = [3]$$$, $$$b = [1,2]$$$, so the value of $$$f(a) + f(b) = 3 + 1.5 = 4.5$$$.
- $$$a = [3,1]$$$, $$$b = [2]$$$, so the value of $$$f(a) + f(b) = 2 + 2 = 4$$$.
- $$$a = [3,2]$$$, $$$b = [1]$$$, so the value of $$$f(a) + f(b) = 2.5 + 1 = 3.5$$$.

In the second test case, the array is $$$[-7, -6, -6]$$$. These are all the possible ways to split this array:

- $$$a = [-7]$$$, $$$b = [-6,-6]$$$, so the value of $$$f(a) + f(b) = (-7) + (-6) = -13$$$.
- $$$a = [-7,-6]$$$, $$$b = [-6]$$$, so the value of $$$f(a) + f(b) = (-6.5) + (-6) = -12.5$$$.
