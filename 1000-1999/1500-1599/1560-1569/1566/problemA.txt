Description:
You are given two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$s$$$. Find the maximum possible median of an array of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers (not necessarily distinct), such that the sum of its elements is equal to $$$s$$$.

A median of an array of integers of length $$$m$$$ is the number standing on the $$$\lceil {\frac{m}{2}} \rceil$$$-th (rounding up) position in the non-decreasing ordering of its elements. Positions are numbered starting from $$$1$$$. For example, a median of the array $$$[20,40,20,50,50,30]$$$ is the $$$\lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil$$$-th element of $$$[20,20,30,40,50,50]$$$, so it is $$$30$$$. There exist other definitions of the median, but in this problem we use the described definition.

Input Format:
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

Each test case contains a single line with two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le n, s \le 10^9$$$) — the length of the array and the required sum of the elements.

Output Format:
For each test case print a single integer — the maximum possible median.

Note:
Possible arrays for the first three test cases (in each array the median is underlined):

- In the first test case $$$[\underline{5}]$$$
- In the second test case $$$[\underline{2}, 3]$$$
- In the third test case $$$[1, \underline{2}, 2]$$$
