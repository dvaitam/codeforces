Description:
This is an interactive problem.

You are given two integers $$$c$$$ and $$$n$$$. The jury has a randomly generated set $$$A$$$ of distinct positive integers not greater than $$$c$$$ (it is generated from all such possible sets with equal probability). The size of $$$A$$$ is equal to $$$n$$$.

Your task is to guess the set $$$A$$$. In order to guess it, you can ask at most $$$\lceil 0.65 \cdot c \rceil$$$ queries.

In each query, you choose a single integer $$$1 \le x \le c$$$. As the answer to this query you will be given the bitwise xor sum of all $$$y$$$, such that $$$y \in A$$$ and $$$gcd(x, y) = 1$$$ (i.e. $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ are coprime). If there is no such $$$y$$$ this xor sum is equal to $$$0$$$.

You can ask all queries at the beginning and you will receive the answers to all your queries. After that, you won't have the possibility to ask queries.

You should find any set $$$A'$$$, such that $$$|A'| = n$$$ and $$$A'$$$ and $$$A$$$ have the same answers for all $$$c$$$ possible queries.

Input Format:
Firstly you are given two integers $$$c$$$ and $$$n$$$ ($$$100 \le c \le 10^6$$$, $$$0 \le n \le c$$$).

Output Format:
None

Note:
The sample is made only for you to understand the interaction protocol. Your solution will not be tested on the sample.

In the sample $$$A = \{1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10\}$$$. $$$7$$$ queries are made, $$$7 \le \lceil 0.65 \cdot 10 \rceil = 7$$$, so the query limit is not exceeded.

Answers for the queries:

- For $$$10$$$: $$$1$$$ is the only number in the set $$$A$$$ coprime with $$$10$$$, so the answer is $$$1$$$
- For $$$2$$$: $$$1_{10} \oplus 5_{10} = 001_2 \oplus 101_2 = 4_{10}$$$, where $$$\oplus$$$ is the bitwise xor
- For $$$3$$$: $$$1_{10} \oplus 4_{10} \oplus 5_{10} \oplus 8_{10} \oplus 10_{10} = 0001_2 \oplus 0100_2 \oplus 0101_2 \oplus 1000_2 \oplus 1010_2 = 2_{10}$$$
- For $$$5$$$: $$$1_{10} \oplus 4_{10} \oplus 6_{10} \oplus 8_{10} = 0001_2 \oplus 0100_2 \oplus 0110_2 \oplus 1000_2 = 11_{10}$$$
- For $$$7$$$: $$$1_{10} \oplus 4_{10} \oplus 5_{10} \oplus 6_{10} \oplus 8_{10} \oplus 10_{10} = 0001_2 \oplus 0100_2 \oplus 0101_2 \oplus 0110_2 \oplus 1000_2 \oplus 1010_2 = 4_{10}$$$
- For $$$1$$$: $$$1_{10} \oplus 4_{10} \oplus 5_{10} \oplus 6_{10} \oplus 8_{10} \oplus 10_{10} = 0001_2 \oplus 0100_2 \oplus 0101_2 \oplus 0110_2 \oplus 1000_2 \oplus 1010_2 = 4_{10}$$$
- For $$$6$$$: $$$1_{10} \oplus 5_{10} = 0001_2 \oplus 0101_2 = 4_{10}$$$
