Description:
Do you know what tubular bells are? They are a musical instrument made up of cylindrical metal tubes. In an orchestra, tubular bells are used to mimic the ringing of bells.

Mike has tubular bells, too! They consist of $$$n$$$ tubes, and each of the tubes has a length that can be expressed by a integer from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ inclusive. It is clear that the lengths of all the tubes are different (it makes no sense to make the same tubes). It is also known that $$$r-l+1 = n$$$.

Formally, we can say that Mike's tubular bells are described by a permutation $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ that contains all numbers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ inclusive, with $$$a_i$$$ denoting the length of the $$$i$$$-th tube.

You are offered an interesting task: to guess what Mike's instrument looks like. Simply, you must guess the permutation.

Mike won't tell you $$$l$$$ or $$$r$$$. He will only tell you $$$n$$$, and will allow you to ask no more than $$$n + 5000$$$ queries.

In each query, you name two positive integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ such that $$$1 \le x, y \le n, x \neq y$$$. In response to this query, the program written by Mike will give you $$$\mathrm{lcm}(a_x, a_y)$$$, where $$$\mathrm{lcm}(c,d)$$$ denotes the least common multiple of $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$.

Solve Mike's problem!

Input Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases.

The first line contains one positive integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 20$$$), denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains one positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 10^5$$$) — number of tubes in Mike's tubular bells. Also $$$1 \le l \le r \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, i.e. the lengths of the tubes do not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of maximal number of queries (i.e. $$$n + 5000$$$) over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5 + 5000$$$. It means that sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$10^5 + 5000 - t \cdot 5000$$$.
