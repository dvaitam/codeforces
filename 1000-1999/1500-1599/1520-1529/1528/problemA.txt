Description:
Parsa has a humongous tree on $$$n$$$ vertices.

On each vertex $$$v$$$ he has written two integers $$$l_v$$$ and $$$r_v$$$.

To make Parsa's tree look even more majestic, Nima wants to assign a number $$$a_v$$$ ($$$l_v \le a_v \le r_v$$$) to each vertex $$$v$$$ such that the beauty of Parsa's tree is maximized.

Nima's sense of the beauty is rather bizarre. He defines the beauty of the tree as the sum of $$$|a_u - a_v|$$$ over all edges $$$(u, v)$$$ of the tree.

Since Parsa's tree is too large, Nima can't maximize its beauty on his own. Your task is to find the maximum possible beauty for Parsa's tree.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1\le t\le 250)$$$ — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(2\le n\le 10^5)$$$ — the number of vertices in Parsa's tree.

The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ $$$(1 \le l_i \le r_i \le 10^9)$$$.

Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ $$$(1 \le u , v \le n, u\neq v)$$$ meaning that there is an edge between the vertices $$$u$$$ and $$$v$$$ in Parsa's tree.

It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

Output Format:
For each test case print the maximum possible beauty for Parsa's tree.

Note:
The trees in the example:

In the first test case, one possible assignment is $$$a = \{1, 8\}$$$ which results in $$$|1 - 8| = 7$$$.

In the second test case, one of the possible assignments is $$$a = \{1, 5, 9\}$$$ which results in a beauty of $$$|1 - 5| + |5 - 9| = 8$$$
