Description:
Given an integer $$$n$$$, find the maximum value of integer $$$k$$$ such that the following condition holds:

$$$n$$$ & ($$$n-1$$$) & ($$$n-2$$$) & ($$$n-3$$$) & ... ($$$k$$$) = $$$0$$$

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^9$$$).

Output Format:
For each test case, output a single integer â€” the required integer $$$k$$$.

Note:
In the first testcase, the maximum value for which the continuous & operation gives 0 value, is 1.

In the second testcase, the maximum value for which the continuous & operation gives 0 value, is 3. No value greater then 3, say for example 4, will give the & sum 0.

- $$$5 \, \& \, 4 \neq 0$$$,
- $$$5 \, \& \, 4 \, \& \, 3 = 0$$$.

Hence, 3 is the answer.
