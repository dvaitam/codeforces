Description:
You are given $$$n$$$ of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. Process $$$q$$$ queries of two types:

- query of the form "0 $$$x_j$$$": add the value $$$x_j$$$ to all even elements of the array $$$a$$$,
- query of the form "1 $$$x_j$$$": add the value $$$x_j$$$ to all odd elements of the array $$$a$$$.

Note that when processing the query, we look specifically at the odd/even value of $$$a_i$$$, not its index.

After processing each query, print the sum of the elements of the array $$$a$$$.

Please note that the answer for some test cases won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language (like long long for C++).

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \leq n$$$, $$$q \leq 10^5$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$ and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains exactly $$$n$$$ integers: $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.

The following $$$q$$$ lines contain queries as two integers $$$type_j$$$ and $$$x_j$$$ $$$(0 \leq type_j \leq 1$$$, $$$1 \leq x_j \leq 10^4$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of values $$$n$$$ over all test cases in a test does not exceed $$$10^5$$$. Similarly, the sum of values $$$q$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

Output Format:
For each test case, print $$$q$$$ numbers: the sum of the elements of the array $$$a$$$ after processing a query.

Note:
In the first test case, the array $$$a = [2]$$$ after the first query.

In the third test case, the array $$$a$$$ is modified as follows: $$$[1, 3, 2, 4, 10, 48]$$$ $$$\rightarrow$$$ $$$[7, 9, 2, 4, 10, 48]$$$ $$$\rightarrow$$$ $$$[7, 9, 7, 9, 15, 53]$$$ $$$\rightarrow$$$ $$$[7, 9, 7, 9, 15, 53]$$$ $$$\rightarrow$$$ $$$[10, 12, 10, 12, 18, 56]$$$ $$$\rightarrow$$$ $$$[22, 24, 22, 24, 30, 68]$$$ $$$\rightarrow$$$ $$$[23, 25, 23, 25, 31, 69]$$$.
