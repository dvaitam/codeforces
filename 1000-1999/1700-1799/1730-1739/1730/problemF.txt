Description:
You are given a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and a positive integer $$$k$$$. Consider a permutation $$$q$$$ of length $$$n$$$ such that for any integers $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, where $$$1 \le i < j \le n$$$, we have $$$$$$p_{q_i} \le p_{q_j} + k.$$$$$$

Find the minimum possible number of inversions in a permutation $$$q$$$.

A permutation is an array consisting of $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in arbitrary order. For example, $$$[2,3,1,5,4]$$$ is a permutation, but $$$[1,2,2]$$$ is not a permutation ($$$2$$$ appears twice in the array) and $$$[1,3,4]$$$ is also not a permutation ($$$n=3$$$ but there is $$$4$$$ in the array).

An inversion in a permutation $$$a$$$ is a pair of indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le i, j \le n$$$) such that $$$i < j$$$, but $$$a_i > a_j$$$.

Input Format:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 5000$$$, $$$1 \le k \le 8$$$).

The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le n$$$).

Output Format:
Print the minimum possible number of inversions in the permutation $$$q$$$.

Note:
In the first example, the only permutation is $$$q = [1]$$$ ($$$0$$$ inversions). Then $$$p_{q_1} = 1$$$.

In the second example, the only permutation with $$$1$$$ inversion is $$$q = [1, 3, 2]$$$. Then $$$p_{q_1} = 2$$$, $$$p_{q_2} = 1$$$, $$$p_{q_3} = 3$$$.

In the third example, one of the possible permutations with $$$6$$$ inversions is $$$q = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]$$$. Then $$$p_{q_1} = 3$$$, $$$p_{q_2} = 2$$$, $$$p_{q_3} = 1$$$, $$$p_{q_4} = 5$$$, $$$p_{q_5} = 4$$$.
