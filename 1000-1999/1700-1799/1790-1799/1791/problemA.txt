Description:
Given a lowercase Latin character (letter), check if it appears in the string $$$\texttt{codeforces}$$$.

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 26$$$) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a character $$$c$$$ — a single lowercase Latin character (letter).

Output Format:
For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if $$$c$$$ satisfies the condition, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note:
None
