Description:
Timur initially had a binary string$$$^{\dagger}$$$ $$$s$$$ (possibly of length $$$0$$$). He performed the following operation several (possibly zero) times:

- Add $$$\texttt{0}$$$ to one end of the string and $$$\texttt{1}$$$ to the other end of the string. For example, starting from the string $$$\texttt{1011}$$$, you can obtain either $$$\color{red}{\texttt{0}}\texttt{1011}\color{red}{\texttt{1}}$$$ or $$$\color{red}{\texttt{1}}\texttt{1011}\color{red}{\texttt{0}}$$$.

$$$^{\dagger}$$$ A binary string is a string (possibly the empty string) whose characters are either $$$\texttt{0}$$$ or $$$\texttt{1}$$$.

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) — the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2000$$$) — the length of Timur's final string.

The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of characters $$$\texttt{0}$$$ or $$$\texttt{1}$$$, denoting the final string.

Output Format:
For each test case, output a single nonnegative integer — the shortest possible length of Timur's original string. Note that Timur's original string could have been empty, in which case you should output $$$0$$$.

Note:
In the first test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is $$$\texttt{0}$$$, and he performed the following operation: $$$\texttt{0} \to \color{red}{\texttt{1}}\texttt{0}\color{red}{\texttt{0}}$$$.

In the second test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is $$$\texttt{11}$$$, and he performed the following operation: $$$\texttt{11} \to \color{red}{\texttt{0}}\texttt{11}\color{red}{\texttt{1}}$$$.

In the third test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is $$$\texttt{10101}$$$, and he didn't perform any operations.

In the fourth test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is the empty string (which we denote by $$$\varepsilon$$$), and he performed the following operations: $$$\varepsilon \to \color{red}{\texttt{1}}\texttt{}\color{red}{\texttt{0}} \to \color{red}{\texttt{0}}\texttt{10}\color{red}{\texttt{1}} \to \color{red}{\texttt{1}}\texttt{0101}\color{red}{\texttt{0}}$$$.

In the fifth test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is $$$\texttt{101}$$$, and he performed the following operations: $$$\texttt{101} \to \color{red}{\texttt{0}}\texttt{101}\color{red}{\texttt{1}} \to \color{red}{\texttt{1}}\texttt{01011}\color{red}{\texttt{0}}$$$.
