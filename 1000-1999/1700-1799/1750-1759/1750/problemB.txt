Description:
A binary string is a string consisting only of the characters 0 and 1. You are given a binary string $$$s$$$.

For some non-empty substring$$$^\dagger$$$ $$$t$$$ of string $$$s$$$ containing $$$x$$$ characters 0 and $$$y$$$ characters 1, define its cost as:

- $$$x \cdot y$$$, if $$$x > 0$$$ and $$$y > 0$$$;
- $$$x^2$$$, if $$$x > 0$$$ and $$$y = 0$$$;
- $$$y^2$$$, if $$$x = 0$$$ and $$$y > 0$$$.

Given a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, find the maximum cost across all its non-empty substrings.

$$$^\dagger$$$ A string $$$a$$$ is a substring of a string $$$b$$$ if $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Input Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

Output Format:
For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum cost across all substrings.

Note:
In the first test case, we can take a substring $$$111$$$. It contains $$$3$$$ characters 1 and $$$0$$$ characters 0. So $$$a = 3$$$, $$$b = 0$$$ and its cost is $$$3^2 = 9$$$.

In the second test case, we can take the whole string. It contains $$$4$$$ characters 1 and $$$3$$$ characters 0. So $$$a = 4$$$, $$$b = 3$$$ and its cost is $$$4 \cdot 3 = 12$$$.

In the third test case, we can can take a substring $$$1111$$$ and its cost is $$$4^2 = 16$$$.

In the fourth test case, we can take the whole string and cost is $$$4 \cdot 3 = 12$$$.

In the fifth test case, we can take a substring $$$000$$$ and its cost is $$$3 \cdot 3 = 9$$$.

In the sixth test case, we can only take the substring $$$0$$$ and its cost is $$$1 \cdot 1 = 1$$$.
