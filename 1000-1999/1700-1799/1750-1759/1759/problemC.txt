Description:
Vlad came home and found out that someone had reconfigured the old thermostat to the temperature of $$$a$$$.

The thermostat can only be set to a temperature from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ inclusive, the temperature cannot change by less than $$$x$$$. Formally, in one operation you can reconfigure the thermostat from temperature $$$a$$$ to temperature $$$b$$$ if $$$|a - b| \ge x$$$ and $$$l \le b \le r$$$.

You are given $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$, $$$x$$$, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. Find the minimum number of operations required to get temperature $$$b$$$ from temperature $$$a$$$, or say that it is impossible.

Input Format:
The first line of input data contains the single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the test.

The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each case contains three integers $$$l$$$, $$$r$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le l \le r \le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \le x \le 10^9$$$) — range of temperature and minimum temperature change.

The second line of each case contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$l \le a, b \le r$$$) — the initial and final temperatures.

Output Format:
Output $$$t$$$ numbers, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. If it is impossible to achieve the temperature $$$b$$$, output -1, otherwise output the minimum number of operations.

Note:
In the first example, the thermostat is already set up correctly.

In the second example, you can achieve the desired temperature as follows: $$$4 \rightarrow 10 \rightarrow 5$$$.

In the third example, you can achieve the desired temperature as follows: $$$3 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 7$$$.

In the fourth test, it is impossible to make any operation.
