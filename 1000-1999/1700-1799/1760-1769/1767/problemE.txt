Description:
Huh, is that it? Slightly disappointed, you boot up the game and click on the new gamemode. It says "Colored platforms".

There are $$$n$$$ platforms, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, placed one after another. There are $$$m$$$ colors available in the game, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. The $$$i$$$-th platform is colored $$$c_i$$$.

You start on the platform $$$1$$$ and want to reach platform $$$n$$$. In one move, you can jump from some platform $$$i$$$ to platforms $$$i + 1$$$ or $$$i + 2$$$.

All platforms are initially deactivated (including platforms $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$). For each color $$$j$$$, you can pay $$$x_j$$$ coins to activate all platforms of that color.

You want to activate some platforms so that you could start on an activated platform $$$1$$$, jump through some activated platforms and reach an activated platform $$$n$$$.

What's the smallest amount of coins you can spend to achieve that?

Input Format:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \le m \le 40$$$) — the number of platforms and the number of colors, respectively.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \le c_i \le m$$$) — the colors of the platforms.

The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$x_1, x_2, \dots, x_m$$$ ($$$1 \le x_i \le 10^7$$$) — the cost of activating all platforms of each color.

Output Format:
Print the smallest amount of coins you can spend to activate some platforms so that you could start on an activated platform $$$1$$$, jump through some activated platforms and reach an activated platform $$$n$$$.

Note:
None
