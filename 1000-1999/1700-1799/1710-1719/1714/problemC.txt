Description:
Find the minimum number with the given sum of digits $$$s$$$ such that all digits in it are distinct (i.e. all digits are unique).

For example, if $$$s=20$$$, then the answer is $$$389$$$. This is the minimum number in which all digits are different and the sum of the digits is $$$20$$$ ($$$3+8+9=20$$$).

For the given $$$s$$$ print the required number.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 45$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case is specified by a line that contains the only integer $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le s \le 45$$$).

Output Format:
Print $$$t$$$ integers — the answers to the given test cases.

Note:
None
