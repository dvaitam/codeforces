Description:
In an ICPC contest, balloons are distributed as follows:

- Whenever a team solves a problem, that team gets a balloon.
- The first team to solve a problem gets an additional balloon.

Determine the total number of balloons that the teams received. Note that some problems may be solved by none of the teams.

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) — the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 50$$$) — the length of the string.

The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of uppercase English letters, denoting the order of solved problems.

Output Format:
For each test case, output a single integer — the total number of balloons that the teams received.

Note:
In the first test case, $$$5$$$ balloons are given out:

- Problem $$$\textsf{A}$$$ is solved. That team receives $$$2$$$ balloons: one because they solved the problem, an an additional one because they are the first team to solve problem $$$\textsf{A}$$$.
- Problem $$$\textsf{B}$$$ is solved. That team receives $$$2$$$ balloons: one because they solved the problem, an an additional one because they are the first team to solve problem $$$\textsf{B}$$$.
- Problem $$$\textsf{A}$$$ is solved. That team receives only $$$1$$$ balloon, because they solved the problem. Note that they don't get an additional balloon because they are not the first team to solve problem $$$\textsf{A}$$$.

In the second test case, there is only one problem solved. The team who solved it receives $$$2$$$ balloons: one because they solved the problem, an an additional one because they are the first team to solve problem $$$\textsf{A}$$$.
