Description:
Monocarp had a permutation $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ occurs exactly once).

Then Monocarp calculated an array of integers $$$b$$$ of size $$$n$$$, where $$$b_i = \left\lfloor \frac{i}{a_i} \right\rfloor$$$. For example, if the permutation $$$a$$$ is $$$[2, 1, 4, 3]$$$, then the array $$$b$$$ is equal to $$$\left[ \left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor \frac{2}{1} \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor \frac{3}{4} \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor \frac{4}{3} \right\rfloor \right] = [0, 2, 0, 1]$$$.

Unfortunately, the Monocarp has lost his permutation, so he wants to restore it. Your task is to find a permutation $$$a$$$ that corresponds to the given array $$$b$$$. If there are multiple possible permutations, then print any of them. The tests are constructed in such a way that least one suitable permutation exists.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$) — number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$).

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$$$ ($$$0 \le b_i \le n$$$).

Additional constrains on the input:

- the sum of $$$n$$$ over test cases does not exceed $$$5 \cdot 10^5$$$;
- there exists at least one permutation $$$a$$$ that would yield this array $$$b$$$.

Output Format:
For each test case, print $$$n$$$ integers — a permutation $$$a$$$ that corresponds to the given array $$$b$$$. If there are multiple possible permutations, then print any of them.

Note:
None
