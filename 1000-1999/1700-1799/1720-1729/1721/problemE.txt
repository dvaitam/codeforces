Description:
You are given a string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

You are asked $$$q$$$ queries about it: given another string $$$t$$$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, perform the following steps:

1. concatenate $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$;
2. calculate the prefix function of the resulting string $$$s+t$$$;
3. print the values of the prefix function on positions $$$|s|+1, |s|+2, \dots, |s|+|t|$$$ ($$$|s|$$$ and $$$|t|$$$ denote the lengths of strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$, respectively);
4. revert the string back to $$$s$$$.

The prefix function of a string $$$a$$$ is a sequence $$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_{|a|}$$$, where $$$p_i$$$ is the maximum value of $$$k$$$ such that $$$k < i$$$ and $$$a[1..k]=a[i-k+1..i]$$$ ($$$a[l..r]$$$ denotes a contiguous substring of a string $$$a$$$ from a position $$$l$$$ to a position $$$r$$$, inclusive). In other words, it's the longest proper prefix of the string $$$a[1..i]$$$ that is equal to its suffix of the same length.

Input Format:
The first line contains a non-empty string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le |s| \le 10^6$$$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

The second line contains a single integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 10^5$$$) — the number of queries.

Each of the next $$$q$$$ lines contains a query: a non-empty string $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le |t| \le 10$$$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

Output Format:
For each query, print the values of the prefix function of a string $$$s+t$$$ on positions $$$|s|+1, |s|+2, \dots, |s|+|t|$$$.
