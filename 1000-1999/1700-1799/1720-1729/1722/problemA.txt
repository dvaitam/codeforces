Description:
Timur likes his name. As a spelling of his name, he allows any permutation of the letters of the name. For example, the following strings are valid spellings of his name: Timur, miurT, Trumi, mriTu. Note that the correct spelling must have uppercased T and lowercased other letters.

Today he wrote string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of uppercase or lowercase Latin letters. He asks you to check if $$$s$$$ is the correct spelling of his name.

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \leq n \leq 10)$$$ — the length of string $$$s$$$.

The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ consisting of only uppercase or lowercase Latin characters.

Output Format:
For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if $$$s$$$ satisfies the condition, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note:
None
