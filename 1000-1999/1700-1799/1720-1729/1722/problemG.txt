Description:
Given an integer $$$n$$$, find any array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ distinct nonnegative integers less than $$$2^{31}$$$ such that the bitwise XOR of the elements on odd indices equals the bitwise XOR of the elements on even indices.

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 629$$$) — the number of test cases.

Then $$$t$$$ lines follow, each containing a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(3 \leq n \leq 2\cdot10^5)$$$ — the length of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.

Output Format:
For each test case, output one line containing $$$n$$$ distinct integers that satisfy the conditions.

If there are multiple answers, you can output any of them.

Note:
In the first test case the XOR on odd indices is $$$4 \oplus 1 \oplus 0 \oplus 7 = 2$$$ and the XOR on even indices is $$$2 \oplus 5 \oplus 6 \oplus 3= 2$$$.
