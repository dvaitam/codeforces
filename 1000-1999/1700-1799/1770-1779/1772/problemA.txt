Description:
You are given an expression of the form $$$a{+}b$$$, where $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$. You have to evaluate it and print the result.

Input Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing an expression of the form $$$a{+}b$$$ ($$$0 \le a, b \le 9$$$, both $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are integers). The integers are not separated from the $$$+$$$ sign.

Output Format:
For each test case, print one integer — the result of the expression.

Note:
None
