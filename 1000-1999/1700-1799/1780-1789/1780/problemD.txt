Description:
This is an interactive problem.

Kira has a hidden positive integer $$$n$$$, and Hayato needs to guess it.

Initially, Kira gives Hayato the value $$$\mathrm{cnt}$$$ — the number of unit bits in the binary notation of $$$n$$$. To guess $$$n$$$, Hayato can only do operations of one kind: choose an integer $$$x$$$ and subtract it from $$$n$$$. Note that after each operation, the number $$$n$$$ changes. Kira doesn't like bad requests, so if Hayato tries to subtract a number $$$x$$$ greater than $$$n$$$, he will lose to Kira. After each operation, Kira gives Hayato the updated value $$$\mathrm{cnt}$$$ — the number of unit bits in the binary notation of the updated value of $$$n$$$.

Kira doesn't have much patience, so Hayato must guess the original value of $$$n$$$ after no more than $$$30$$$ operations.

Since Hayato is in elementary school, he asks for your help. Write a program that guesses the number $$$n$$$. Kira is an honest person, so he chooses the initial number $$$n$$$ before all operations and does not change it afterward.

Input Format:
The input data contains several test cases. The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains the number $$$\mathrm{cnt}$$$ — the initial number of unit bits in the binary notation $$$n$$$.

The hidden integer $$$n$$$ satisfies the following constraint: $$$1 \le n \le 10^9$$$.

Output Format:
None

Note:
For example, the number of unit bits in number $$$6$$$ is $$$2$$$, because binary notation of $$$6$$$ is $$$110$$$. For $$$13$$$ the number of unit bits is $$$3$$$, because $$$13_{10} = 1101_2$$$.

In the first test case, $$$n = 1$$$, so the input is the number $$$1$$$. After subtracting one from $$$n$$$, it becomes zero, so the number of unit bits in it is $$$0$$$.

In the third test case, $$$n = 3$$$, which in binary representation looks like $$$3_{10} = 11_2$$$, so the input is the number of ones, that is $$$2$$$. After subtracting $$$2$$$, $$$n = 1$$$, so the number of unit bits is now $$$1$$$. After subtracting one from $$$n$$$, it becomes equal to zero.

Note that the blank lines in the input and output examples are shown for clarity and are not present in the actual interaction.
