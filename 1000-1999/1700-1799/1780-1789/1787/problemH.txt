Description:
You are participating in a Codeforces Round with $$$n$$$ problems.

You spend exactly one minute to solve each problem, the time it takes to submit a problem can be ignored. You can only solve at most one problem at any time. The contest starts at time $$$0$$$, so you can make your first submission at any time $$$t \ge 1$$$ minutes. Whenever you submit a problem, it is always accepted.

The scoring of the $$$i$$$-th problem can be represented by three integers $$$k_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$, and $$$a_i$$$. If you solve it at time $$$t$$$ minutes, you get $$$\max(b_i - k_i \cdot t,a_i)$$$ points.

Your task is to choose an order to solve all these $$$n$$$ problems to get the maximum possible score. You can assume the contest is long enough to solve all problems.

Input Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of problems.

The $$$n$$$ lines follow, the $$$i$$$-th of them contains three integers $$$k_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$, $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1\le k_i,b_i,a_i\le 10^9$$$; $$$a_i < b_i$$$), denoting that you get the score of $$$\max(b_i - k_i \cdot t,a_i)$$$ if you solve the $$$i$$$-th task at time $$$t$$$ minutes.

It's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

Output Format:
For each test case, print a line containing a single integer — the maximum score you can get.

Note:
In the second test case, the points for all problems at each minute are listed below.
