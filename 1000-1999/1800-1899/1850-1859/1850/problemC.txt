Description:
On an $$$8 \times 8$$$ grid of dots, a word consisting of lowercase Latin letters is written vertically in one column, from top to bottom. What is it?

Input Format:
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of $$$8$$$ lines, each containing $$$8$$$ characters. Each character in the grid is either $$$\texttt{.}$$$ (representing a dot) or a lowercase Latin letter ($$$\texttt{a}$$$–$$$\texttt{z}$$$).

The word lies entirely in a single column and is continuous from the beginning to the ending (without gaps). See the sample input for better understanding.

Output Format:
For each test case, output a single line containing the word made up of lowercase Latin letters ($$$\texttt{a}$$$–$$$\texttt{z}$$$) that is written vertically in one column from top to bottom.
