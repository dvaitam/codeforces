Description:
You have an array $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$.

Your task is to answer $$$q$$$ queries: given $$$x,y$$$, find the number of pairs $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le i < j \le n$$$) that both $$$a_i + a_j = x$$$ and $$$a_i \cdot a_j = y$$$.

That is, for the array $$$[1,3,2]$$$ and asking for $$$x=3,y=2$$$ the answer is $$$1$$$:

- $$$i=1$$$ and $$$j=2$$$ fail because $$$1 + 3 = 4$$$ and not $$$3,$$$ also $$$1 \cdot 3=3$$$ and not $$$2$$$;
- $$$i=1$$$ and $$$j=3$$$ satisfies both conditions;
- $$$i=2$$$ and $$$j=3$$$ fail because $$$3 + 2 = 5$$$ and not $$$3,$$$ also $$$3 \cdot 2=6$$$ and not $$$2$$$;

Input Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The second line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$.

The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le |a_i| \le 10^9$$$) — array $$$a$$$.

The fourth line of each test case contains the integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of requests.

The next $$$q$$$ lines contain two numbers each $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \le |x|\le 2\cdot 10^9,1\le |y|\le 10^{18}$$$) — request.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$. This is also guaranteed for the sum of $$$q$$$ values.

Output Format:
For each test case print a line with $$$q$$$ numbers — the answers to the queries.

Note:
For the first test case, let's analyze each pair of numbers separately:

- pair $$$(a_1,a_2)$$$: $$$a_1 + a_2 = 4$$$, $$$a_1 \cdot a_2 = 3$$$
- pair $$$(a_1,a_3)$$$: $$$a_1 + a_3 = 3$$$, $$$a_1 \cdot a_3 = 2$$$
- pair $$$(a_2,a_3)$$$: $$$a_2 + a_3 = 5$$$, $$$a_2 \cdot a_3 = 6$$$

In the second test case, all combinations of pairs are suitable.
