Description:
A $$$10 \times 10$$$ target is made out of five "rings" as shown. Each ring has a different point value: the outermost ring — 1 point, the next ring — 2 points, ..., the center ring — 5 points.

Vlad fired several arrows at the target. Help him determine how many points he got.

Input Format:
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of 10 lines, each containing 10 characters. Each character in the grid is either $$$\texttt{X}$$$ (representing an arrow) or $$$\texttt{.}$$$ (representing no arrow).

Output Format:
For each test case, output a single integer — the total number of points of the arrows.

Note:
In the first test case, there are three arrows on the outer ring worth 1 point each, two arrows on the ring worth 3 points each, and two arrows on the ring worth 4 points each. The total score is $$$3 \times 1 + 2 \times 3 + 2 \times 4 = 17$$$.

In the second test case, there aren't any arrows, so the score is $$$0$$$.
