Description:
You are given positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. For each number from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, we write its representation in the number system with base $$$k$$$ (without leading zeros) and then sort the resulting array in lexicographic order as strings. In the sorted array, we number the elements from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (i.e., indexing starts from $$$1$$$). Find the number of values $$$i$$$ such that the representation of number $$$i$$$ is at the $$$i$$$-th position in the sorted array of representations.

Examples of representations: $$$1$$$ in any number system is equal to $$$1$$$, $$$7$$$ with $$$k = 3$$$ is written as $$$21$$$, and $$$81$$$ with $$$k = 9$$$ is written as $$$100$$$.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$$$, $$$2 \leq k \leq 10^{18}$$$).

Output Format:
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of values $$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$ such that the representation of number $$$i$$$ in the number system with base $$$k$$$ is at the $$$i$$$-th position after sorting.

Note:
In the first test case, for numbers $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, their representations are at positions $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ respectively.

In the second test case, the sorted array is $$$[1_2 = 1, 10_2 = 2, 100_2 = 4, 11_2 = 3]$$$, and only the representations of numbers $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$ are at the required positions.

In the third test case, the sorted array is $$$[1_4 = 1, 10_4 = 4, 11_4 = 5, 12_4 = 6, 2_4 = 2, 3_4 = 3]$$$, and only the number $$$1$$$ is at its position.
