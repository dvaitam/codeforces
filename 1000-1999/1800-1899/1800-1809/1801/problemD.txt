Description:
He's going to get there by plane. In total, there are $$$m$$$ flights in the country, $$$i$$$-th flies from city $$$a_i$$$ to city $$$b_i$$$ and costs $$$s_i$$$ coins. Note that the $$$i$$$-th flight is one-way, so it can't be used to get from city $$$b_i$$$ to city $$$a_i$$$. To use it, Borya must be in the city $$$a_i$$$ and have at least $$$s_i$$$ coins (which he will spend on the flight).

After the robbery, he has only $$$p$$$ coins left, but he does not despair! Being in the city $$$i$$$, he can organize performances every day, each performance will bring him $$$w_i$$$ coins.

Help the magician find out if he will be able to get home, and what is the minimum number of performances he will have to organize.

Input Format:
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 80$$$) – the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$p$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 800$$$, $$$1 \le m \le 3000$$$, $$$0 \le p \le 10^9$$$) — the number of cities, the number of flights and the initial amount of coins.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$$$ $$$(1 \le w_i \le 10^9)$$$ — profit from representations.

The following $$$m$$$ lines each contain three integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$b_i$$$ and $$$s_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i, b_i \le n$$$, $$$1 \le s_i \le 10^9$$$) — the starting and ending city, and the cost of $$$i$$$-th flight.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$800$$$ and the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10000$$$.

Output Format:
For each test case print a single integer — the minimum number of performances Borya will have to organize to get home, or $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible to do this.

Note:
In the first example, it is optimal for Borya to make $$$4$$$ performances in the first city, having as a result $$$2 + 7 \cdot 4 = 30$$$ coins, and then walk along the route $$$1-3-2-4$$$, spending $$$6+8+11=25$$$ coins.  In the second example, it is optimal for Borya to make $$$15$$$ performances in the first city, fly to $$$3$$$ city, make $$$9$$$ performances there, and then go to $$$4$$$ city.
