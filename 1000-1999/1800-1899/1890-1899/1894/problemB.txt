Description:
You are given an array $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. You need to find an array $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ consisting of numbers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ such that exactly two out of the following three conditions are satisfied:

1. There exist indices $$$1 \leq i, j \leq n$$$ such that $$$a_i = a_j$$$, $$$b_i = 1$$$, $$$b_j = 2$$$.
2. There exist indices $$$1 \leq i, j \leq n$$$ such that $$$a_i = a_j$$$, $$$b_i = 1$$$, $$$b_j = 3$$$.
3. There exist indices $$$1 \leq i, j \leq n$$$ such that $$$a_i = a_j$$$, $$$b_i = 2$$$, $$$b_j = 3$$$.

If such an array does not exist, you should report it.

Input Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \leq t \leq 500)$$$ — the number of test cases. Each test case is described as follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \leq n \leq 100)$$$ — the length of the array $$$a$$$.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ $$$(1 \leq a_i \leq 100)$$$ — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.

Output Format:
For each test case, print -1 if there is no solution. Otherwise, print $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ — an array consisting of numbers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ that satisfies exactly two out of three conditions. If there are multiple possible answers, you can print any of them.

Note:
In the first test case, $$$b = [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1]$$$ satisfies condition $$$1$$$ because for $$$i = 4$$$, $$$j = 2$$$: $$$a_i = a_j$$$, $$$b_i = 1$$$, and $$$b_j = 2$$$. It also satisfies condition $$$2$$$ because for $$$i = 6$$$, $$$j = 3$$$: $$$a_i = a_j$$$, $$$b_i = 1$$$, and $$$b_j = 3$$$. However, it does not satisfy condition $$$3$$$. In total, exactly two out of three conditions are satisfied.
