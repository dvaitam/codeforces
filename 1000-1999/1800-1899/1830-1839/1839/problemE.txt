Description:
This is an interactive problem.

Consider the following game for two players:

- Initially, an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ of length $$$n$$$ is written on blackboard.
- Game consists of rounds. On each round, the following happens:   The first player selects any $$$i$$$ such that $$$a_i \gt 0$$$. If there is no such $$$i$$$, the first player loses the game (the second player wins) and game ends.  The second player selects any $$$j \neq i$$$ such that $$$a_j \gt 0$$$. If there is no such $$$j$$$, the second player loses the game (the first player wins) and game ends.  Let $$$d = \min(a_i, a_j)$$$. The values of $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ are simultaneously decreased by $$$d$$$ and the next round starts.

It can be shown that game always ends after the finite number of rounds.

You have to select which player you will play for (first or second) and win the game.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 300$$$) — the length of array $$$a$$$.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 300$$$) — array $$$a$$$.

Output Format:
None

Note:
In the first example $$$n = 4$$$ and array $$$a$$$ is $$$[\, 10, 4, 6, 3 \,]$$$. The game goes as follows:

- After reading array $$$a$$$ contestant's program chooses to play as the first player and prints "First".
- First round: the first player chooses $$$i = 1$$$, the second player chooses $$$j = 3$$$. $$$d = \min(a_1, a_3) = \min(10, 6) = 6$$$ is calculated. Elements $$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_3$$$ are decreased by $$$6$$$. Array $$$a$$$ becomes equal to $$$[\, 4, 4, 0, 3 \,]$$$.
- Second round: the first player chooses $$$i = 2$$$, the second player chooses $$$j = 1$$$. $$$d = \min(a_2, a_1) = \min(4, 4) = 4$$$ is calculated. Elements $$$a_2$$$ and $$$a_1$$$ are decreased by $$$4$$$. Array $$$a$$$ becomes equal to $$$[\, 0, 0, 0, 3 \,]$$$.
- Third round: the first player chooses $$$i = 4$$$. There is no $$$j \neq 4$$$ such that $$$a_j > 0$$$, so the second player can't make a correct move and the first player wins. Jury's program prints $$$j = 0$$$. After reading it, contestant's program terminates.

In the second example $$$n = 6$$$ and array $$$a$$$ is $$$[\, 4, 5, 5, 11, 3, 2 \,]$$$. The game goes as follows:

- Contestant's program chooses to play as the second player and prints "Second".
- First round: $$$i = 2$$$, $$$j = 4$$$, $$$a = [\, 4, 0, 5, 6, 3, 2 \,]$$$.
- Second round: $$$i = 5$$$, $$$j = 4$$$, $$$a = [\, 4, 0, 5, 3, 0, 2 \,]$$$.
- Third round: $$$i = 4$$$, $$$j = 3$$$, $$$a = [\, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2 \,]$$$.
- Fourth round: $$$i = 6$$$, $$$j = 1$$$, $$$a = [\, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0 \,]$$$.
- Fifth round: $$$i = 1$$$, $$$j = 3$$$, $$$a = [\, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 \,]$$$.
- Sixth round: the first player can't make a correct move and the second player wins. Jury's program prints $$$i = 0$$$. After reading it, contestant's program terminates.

Note that the example interaction contains extra empty lines so that it's easier to read. The real interaction doesn't contain any empty lines and you shouldn't print any extra empty lines as well.
