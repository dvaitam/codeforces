Description:
Sadly, the problem setter couldn't think of an interesting story, thus he just asks you to solve the following problem.

Given an array $$$a$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers, count the number of non-empty subsequences for which the bitwise $$$\mathsf{AND}$$$ of the elements in the subsequence has exactly $$$k$$$ set bits in its binary representation. The answer may be large, so output it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.

Recall that the subsequence of an array $$$a$$$ is a sequence that can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by removing some (possibly, zero) elements. For example, $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$, $$$[3]$$$, $$$[1, 3]$$$ are subsequences of $$$[1, 2, 3]$$$, but $$$[3, 2]$$$ and $$$[4, 5, 6]$$$ are not.

Note that $$$\mathsf{AND}$$$ represents the bitwise AND operation.

Input Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case consists of two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$0 \le k \le 6$$$) — the length of the array and the number of set bits that the bitwise $$$\mathsf{AND}$$$ the counted subsequences should have in their binary representation.

The second line of each test case consists of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_i \leq 63$$$) — the array $$$a$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

Output Format:
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of subsequences that have exactly $$$k$$$ set bits in their bitwise $$$\mathsf{AND}$$$ value's binary representation. The answer may be large, so output it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.

Note:
None
