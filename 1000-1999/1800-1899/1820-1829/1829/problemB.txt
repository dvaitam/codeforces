Description:
You are given a binary array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ elements, a binary array is an array consisting only of $$$0$$$s and $$$1$$$s.

A blank space is a segment of consecutive elements consisting of only $$$0$$$s.

Your task is to find the length of the longest blank space.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 100$$$) — the length of the array.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$0 \leq a_i \leq 1$$$) — the elements of the array.

Output Format:
For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest blank space.

Note:
None
