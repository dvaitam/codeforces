Description:
You are given $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. You choose any subset of the given numbers (possibly, none or all numbers) and negate these numbers (i.Â e. change $$$x \to (-x)$$$). What is the maximum number of different values in the array you can achieve?

Input Format:
The first line of input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$): the number of test cases.

The next lines contain the description of the $$$t$$$ test cases, two lines per a test case.

In the first line you are given one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 100$$$): the number of integers in the array.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-100 \leq a_i \leq 100$$$).

Output Format:
For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of different elements in the array that you can achieve negating numbers in the array.

Note:
In the first example we can, for example, negate the first and the last numbers, achieving the array $$$[-1, 1, 2, -2]$$$ with four different values.

In the second example all three numbers are already different.

In the third example negation does not change anything.
