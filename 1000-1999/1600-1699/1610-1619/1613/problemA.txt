Description:
Monocarp wrote down two numbers on a whiteboard. Both numbers follow a specific format: a positive integer $$$x$$$ with $$$p$$$ zeros appended to its end.

Now Monocarp asks you to compare these two numbers. Can you help him?

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains two integers $$$x_1$$$ and $$$p_1$$$ ($$$1 \le x_1 \le 10^6; 0 \le p_1 \le 10^6$$$) — the description of the first number.

The second line of each testcase contains two integers $$$x_2$$$ and $$$p_2$$$ ($$$1 \le x_2 \le 10^6; 0 \le p_2 \le 10^6$$$) — the description of the second number.

Output Format:
For each testcase print the result of the comparison of the given two numbers. If the first number is smaller than the second one, print '<'. If the first number is greater than the second one, print '>'. If they are equal, print '='.

Note:
The comparisons in the example are: $$$20 > 19$$$, $$$1000 = 1000$$$, $$$1999 < 2000$$$, $$$1 = 1$$$, $$$99 < 100$$$.
