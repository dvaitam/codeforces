Description:
You are given a pair of integers $$$(a, b)$$$ and an integer $$$x$$$.

You can change the pair in two different ways:

- set (assign) $$$a := |a - b|$$$;
- set (assign) $$$b := |a - b|$$$,

The pair $$$(a, b)$$$ is called $$$x$$$-magic if $$$x$$$ is obtainable either as $$$a$$$ or as $$$b$$$ using only the given operations (i.e. the pair $$$(a, b)$$$ is $$$x$$$-magic if $$$a = x$$$ or $$$b = x$$$ after some number of operations applied). You can apply the operations any number of times (even zero).

Your task is to find out if the pair $$$(a, b)$$$ is $$$x$$$-magic or not.

You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) â€” the number of test cases. The next $$$t$$$ lines describe test cases.

The only line of the test case contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le a, b, x \le 10^{18}$$$).

Output Format:
For the $$$i$$$-th test case, print YES if the corresponding pair $$$(a, b)$$$ is $$$x$$$-magic and NO otherwise.

Note:
None
