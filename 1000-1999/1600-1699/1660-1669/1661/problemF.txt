Description:
There are $$$n+1$$$ teleporters on a straight line, located in points $$$0$$$, $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$a_3$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$. It's possible to teleport from point $$$x$$$ to point $$$y$$$ if there are teleporters in both of those points, and it costs $$$(x-y)^2$$$ energy.

You want to install some additional teleporters so that it is possible to get from the point $$$0$$$ to the point $$$a_n$$$ (possibly through some other teleporters) spending no more than $$$m$$$ energy in total. Each teleporter you install must be located in an integer point.

What is the minimum number of teleporters you have to install?

Input Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9$$$).

The third line contains one integer $$$m$$$ ($$$a_n \le m \le 10^{18}$$$).

Output Format:
Print one integer â€” the minimum number of teleporters you have to install so that it is possible to get from $$$0$$$ to $$$a_n$$$ spending at most $$$m$$$ energy. It can be shown that it's always possible under the constraints from the input format.

Note:
