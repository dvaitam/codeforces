Description:
Marisa comes to pick mushrooms in the Enchanted Forest.

The Enchanted forest can be represented by $$$n$$$ points on the $$$X$$$-axis numbered $$$1$$$ through $$$n$$$. Before Marisa started, her friend, Patchouli, used magic to detect the initial number of mushroom on each point, represented by $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$.

Marisa can start out at any point in the forest on minute $$$0$$$. Each minute, the followings happen in order:

- She moves from point $$$x$$$ to $$$y$$$ ($$$|x-y|\le 1$$$, possibly $$$y=x$$$).
- She collects all mushrooms on point $$$y$$$.
- A new mushroom appears on each point in the forest.

Note that she cannot collect mushrooms on minute $$$0$$$.

Now, Marisa wants to know the maximum number of mushrooms she can pick after $$$k$$$ minutes.

Input Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5$$$, $$$1\le k \le 10^9$$$) — the number of positions with mushrooms and the time Marisa has, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the initial number of mushrooms on point $$$1,2,\ldots,n$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10 ^ 5$$$.

Output Format:
For each test case, print the maximum number of mushrooms Marisa can pick after $$$k$$$ minutes.

Note:
Test case 1:

Marisa can start at $$$x=2$$$. In the first minute, she moves to $$$x=1$$$ and collect $$$5$$$ mushrooms. The number of mushrooms will be $$$[1,7,2,3,4]$$$. In the second minute, she moves to $$$x=2$$$ and collects $$$7$$$ mushrooms. The numbers of mushrooms will be $$$[2,1,3,4,5]$$$. After $$$2$$$ minutes, Marisa collects $$$12$$$ mushrooms.

It can be shown that it is impossible to collect more than $$$12$$$ mushrooms.

Test case 2:

This is one of her possible moving path:

$$$2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 5$$$

It can be shown that it is impossible to collect more than $$$37$$$ mushrooms.
