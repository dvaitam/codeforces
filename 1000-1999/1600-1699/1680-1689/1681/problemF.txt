Description:
You are given a tree, consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices. Each edge has an integer value written on it.

Let $$$f(v, u)$$$ be the number of values that appear exactly once on the edges of a simple path between vertices $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$.

Calculate the sum of $$$f(v, u)$$$ over all pairs of vertices $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ such that $$$1 \le v < u \le n$$$.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices in the tree.

Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains three integers $$$v, u$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le v, u, x \le n$$$) — the description of an edge: the vertices it connects and the value written on it.

The given edges form a tree.

Output Format:
Print a single integer — the sum of $$$f(v, u)$$$ over all pairs of vertices $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ such that $$$v < u$$$.

Note:
None
