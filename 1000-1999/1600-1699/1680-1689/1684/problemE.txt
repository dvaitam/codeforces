Description:
You are given an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ non-negative integers. In one operation you can change any number in the array to any other non-negative integer.

Let's define the cost of the array as $$$\operatorname{DIFF}(a) - \operatorname{MEX}(a)$$$, where $$$\operatorname{MEX}$$$ of a set of non-negative integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set, and $$$\operatorname{DIFF}$$$ is the number of different numbers in the array.

For example, $$$\operatorname{MEX}(\{1, 2, 3\}) = 0$$$, $$$\operatorname{MEX}(\{0, 1, 2, 4, 5\}) = 3$$$.

You should find the minimal cost of the array $$$a$$$ if you are allowed to make at most $$$k$$$ operations.

Input Format:
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^5$$$, $$$0 \le k \le 10^5$$$) — the length of the array $$$a$$$ and the number of operations that you are allowed to make.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

Output Format:
For each test case output a single integer — minimal cost that it is possible to get making at most $$$k$$$ operations.

Note:
In the first test case no operations are needed to minimize the value of $$$\operatorname{DIFF} - \operatorname{MEX}$$$.

In the second test case it is possible to replace $$$5$$$ by $$$1$$$. After that the array $$$a$$$ is $$$[0,\, 2,\, 4,\, 1]$$$, $$$\operatorname{DIFF} = 4$$$, $$$\operatorname{MEX} = \operatorname{MEX}(\{0, 1, 2, 4\}) = 3$$$, so the answer is $$$1$$$.

In the third test case one possible array $$$a$$$ is $$$[4,\, 13,\, 0,\, 0,\, 13,\, 1,\, 2]$$$, $$$\operatorname{DIFF} = 5$$$, $$$\operatorname{MEX} = 3$$$.

In the fourth test case one possible array $$$a$$$ is $$$[1,\, 2,\, 3,\, 0,\, 0,\, 0]$$$.
