Description:
Fishingprince loves trees. A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.

Fishingprince has a tree of $$$n$$$ vertices. The vertices are numbered $$$1$$$ through $$$n$$$. Let $$$d(x,y)$$$ denote the shortest distance on the tree from vertex $$$x$$$ to vertex $$$y$$$, assuming that the length of each edge is $$$1$$$.

However, the tree was lost in an accident. Fortunately, Fishingprince still remembers some information about the tree. More specifically, for every triple of integers $$$x,y,z$$$ ($$$1\le x<y\le n$$$, $$$1\le z\le n$$$) he remembers whether $$$d(x,z)=d(y,z)$$$ or not.

Help him recover the structure of the tree, or report that no tree satisfying the constraints exists.

Input Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 200$$$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\le n\le 100$$$) â€” the number of vertices in the tree.

Then $$$n-1$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line of these $$$n-1$$$ lines contains $$$n-i$$$ strings of length $$$n$$$ consisting of 0 and 1. If the $$$k$$$-th character in the $$$j$$$-th string of the $$$i$$$-th line is 0, it means that $$$d(i,k)\ne d(i+j,k)$$$; if the $$$k$$$-th character in the $$$j$$$-th string of the $$$i$$$-th line is 1, it means that $$$d(i,k)=d(i+j,k)$$$.

It is guaranteed that in one input file,

- there are at most $$$2$$$ test cases that have $$$n>50$$$;
- there are at most $$$5$$$ test cases that have $$$n>20$$$.

Output Format:
For each test case:

- if no answer exists, output No;
- otherwise, on the first line output Yes. Then output $$$n-1$$$ lines. Each line should contain two integers $$$x,y$$$ ($$$1\le x,y\le n$$$), denoting an edge between vertices $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ of the tree. If there are multiple solutions, print any.

When printing Yes and No, you can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Note:
None
