Description:
This is an interactive problem. Remember to flush your output while communicating with the testing program. You may use fflush(stdout) in C++, system.out.flush() in Java, stdout.flush() in Python or flush(output) in Pascal to flush the output. If you use some other programming language, consult its documentation. You may also refer to the guide on interactive problems: https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307.

The jury has chosen a string $$$s$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ characters; each character of $$$s$$$ is a lowercase Latin letter. Your task is to guess this string; initially, you know only its length.

You may ask queries of two types:

- $$$1$$$ $$$i$$$ — the query of the first type, where $$$i$$$ is an integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. In response to this query, the jury will tell you the character $$$s_i$$$;
- $$$2$$$ $$$l$$$ $$$r$$$ — the query of the second type, where $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ are integers such that $$$1 \le l \le r \le n$$$. In response to this query, the jury will tell you the number of different characters among $$$s_l, s_{l+1}, \dots, s_r$$$.

You are allowed to ask no more than $$$26$$$ queries of the first type, and no more than $$$6000$$$ queries of the second type. Your task is to restore the string $$$s$$$.

For each test in this problem, the string $$$s$$$ is fixed beforehand, and will be the same for every submission.

Input Format:
Initially, the jury program sends one integer $$$n$$$ on a separate line — the size of $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 1000$$$).

Output Format:
To give the answer, print one line ! s with a line break in the end, where $$$s$$$ should be the string picked by the jury. After that, your program should flush the output and terminate gracefully.

Note:
Let's analyze the example of interaction.

The string chosen by the jury is guess, so initially the jury sends one integer $$$5$$$.

1. the first query is ? 2 1 5, which means "count the number of different characters among $$$s_1, s_2, \dots, s_5$$$". The answer to it is $$$4$$$.
2. the second query is ? 1 2, which means "tell which character is $$$s_2$$$". The answer to it is u.
3. the third query is ? 2 1 2, which means "count the number of different characters among $$$s_1$$$ and $$$s_2$$$". The answer to it is $$$2$$$.
4. the fourth query is ? 1 1, which means "tell which character is $$$s_1$$$". The answer to it is g.
5. the fifth query is ? 1 3, which means "tell which character is $$$s_3$$$". The answer to it is e.
6. the sixth query is ? 1 4, which means "tell which character is $$$s_4$$$". The answer to it is s.
7. the seventh query is ? 2 4 5, which means "count the number of different characters among $$$s_4$$$ and $$$s_5$$$". The answer to it is $$$1$$$, so it's possible to deduce that $$$s_4$$$ is the same as $$$s_5$$$.

In the end, the answer is submitted as ! guess, and it is deduced correctly.
