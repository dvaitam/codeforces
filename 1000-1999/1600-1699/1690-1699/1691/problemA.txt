Description:
Given a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$, find the minimum number of elements to remove from the sequence such that after the removal, the sum of every $$$2$$$ consecutive elements is even.

Input Format:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \le n \le 10^5$$$).

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2,\dots,a_n$$$ ($$$1\leq a_i\leq10^9$$$) — elements of the sequence.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$.

Output Format:
For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of elements to remove from the sequence such that the sum of every $$$2$$$ consecutive elements is even.

Note:
In the first test case, after removing $$$3$$$, the sequence becomes $$$[2,4,6,8]$$$. The pairs of consecutive elements are $$$\{[2, 4], [4, 6], [6, 8]\}$$$. Each consecutive pair has an even sum now. Hence, we only need to remove $$$1$$$ element to satisfy the condition asked.

In the second test case, each consecutive pair already has an even sum so we need not remove any element.
