Description:
In Berland, $$$n$$$ different types of banknotes are used. Banknotes of the $$$i$$$-th type have denomination $$$10^{a_i}$$$ burles (burles are the currency used in Berland); the denomination of banknotes of the first type is exactly $$$1$$$.

Let's denote $$$f(s)$$$ as the minimum number of banknotes required to represent exactly $$$s$$$ burles. For example, if the denominations of banknotes used in Berland are $$$1$$$, $$$10$$$ and $$$100$$$, then $$$f(59) = 14$$$: $$$9$$$ banknotes with denomination of $$$1$$$ burle and $$$5$$$ banknotes with denomination of $$$10$$$ burles can be used to represent exactly $$$9 \cdot 1 + 5 \cdot 10 = 59$$$ burles, and there's no way to do it with fewer banknotes.

For a given integer $$$k$$$, find the minimum positive number of burles $$$s$$$ that cannot be represented with $$$k$$$ or fewer banknotes (that is, $$$f(s) > k$$$).

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10; 1 \le k \le 10^9$$$).

The next line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 = a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 9$$$).

Output Format:
For each test case, print one integer — the minimum positive number of burles $$$s$$$ that cannot be represented with $$$k$$$ or fewer banknotes.
