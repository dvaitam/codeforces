Description:
You are given a rooted tree, consisting of $$$n$$$ vertices, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Vertex $$$1$$$ is the root. Additionally, the root only has one child.

You are asked to add exactly $$$k$$$ edges to the tree (possibly, multiple edges and/or edges already existing in the tree).

Recall that a bridge is such an edge that, after you remove it, the number of connected components in the graph increases. So, initially, all edges of the tree are bridges.

After $$$k$$$ edges are added, some original edges of the tree are still bridges and some are not anymore. You want to satisfy two conditions:

- for every bridge, all tree edges in the subtree of the lower vertex of that bridge should also be bridges;
- the number of bridges is as small as possible.

Solve the task for all values of $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$ and output the smallest number of bridges.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices of the tree.

Each of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contain two integers $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \le v, u \le n$$$) — the description of the edges of the tree. It's guaranteed that the given edges form a valid tree.

Additional constraint on the input: the root (vertex $$$1$$$) has exactly one child.

The sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.

Output Format:
For each testcase, print $$$n - 1$$$ integers. For each $$$k$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n - 1$$$ print the smallest number of bridges that can be left after you add $$$k$$$ edges to the tree.
