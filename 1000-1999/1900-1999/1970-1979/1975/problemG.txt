Description:
One day, Zimpha casually came up with a problem. As a member of "Zimpha fan club", you decided to solve that problem.

You are given two strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, respectively. Both strings only consist of lowercase English letters, - and *.

You need to replace all occurrences of * and -, observing the following rules:

- For each -, you must replace it with any lowercase English letter.
- For each *, you must replace it with a string of any (possibly, zero) length which only consists of lowercase English letters.

Note that you can replace two different instances of - with different characters. You can also replace each two different instances of * with different strings.

Suppose $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ have been transformed into $$$s'$$$ and $$$t'$$$. Now you're wondering if there's a replacement that makes $$$s'=t'$$$.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6$$$) — the length of the strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$, respectively.

The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$s$$$ only consists of lowercase English letters, - and *.

The third line contains the string $$$t$$$ of length $$$m$$$. It is guaranteed that $$$t$$$ only consists of lowercase English letters, - and *.

Output Format:
For each test case, output "Yes" if there is a replacement that makes $$$s'=t'$$$, and output "No" otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Note:
In the second test case, we can transform both strings into ttklwxx. In $$$s$$$, - will be replaced with l. In $$$t$$$, * will be replaced by the empty string with the first and second - will be replaced with k and w respectively.

In the fifth test case, we can transform both strings into bulijiojioxdibuliduo.
