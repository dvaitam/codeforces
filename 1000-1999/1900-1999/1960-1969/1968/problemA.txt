Description:
You are given an integer $$$x$$$. Your task is to find any integer $$$y$$$ $$$(1\le y<x)$$$ such that $$$\gcd(x,y)+y$$$ is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one $$$y$$$ which satisfies the statement, you are allowed to find any.

$$$\gcd(a,b)$$$ is the Greatest Common Divisor of $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. For example, $$$\gcd(6,4)=2$$$.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$)Â â€” the number of test cases.

Each of the following $$$t$$$ lines contains a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$2 \le x \le 1000$$$).

Output Format:
For each test case, output any $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \le y < x$$$), which satisfies the statement.

Note:
None
