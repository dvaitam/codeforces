E. Triple Operationstime limit per test1 secondmemory limit per test256 megabytesinputstandard inputoutputstandard outputOn the board Ivy wrote down all integers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$, inclusive.In an operation, she does the following:   pick two numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ on the board, erase them, and in their place write the numbers $$$3x$$$ and $$$\lfloor \frac{y}{3} \rfloor$$$. (Here $$$\lfloor \bullet \rfloor$$$ denotes rounding down to the nearest integer). What is the minimum number of operations Ivy needs to make all numbers on the board equal $$$0$$$? We have a proof that this is always possible.InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \leq l < r \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).OutputFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations needed to make all numbers on the board equal $$$0$$$.ExampleInput41 32 4199999 20000019 84Output5

NoteIn the first test case, we can perform $$$5$$$ operations as follows: $$$$$$ 1,2,3 \xrightarrow[x=1,\,y=2]{} 3,0,3 \xrightarrow[x=0,\,y=3]{} 1,0,3 \xrightarrow[x=0,\,y=3]{} 1,0,1 \xrightarrow[x=0,\,y=1]{} 0,0,1 \xrightarrow[x=0,\,y=1]{} 0,0,0 .$$$$$$
