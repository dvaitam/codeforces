Description:
Matthew is given two strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both of length $$$3$$$. He thinks it's particularly funny to create two new words by swapping the first character of $$$a$$$ with the first character of $$$b$$$. He wants you to output $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ after the swap.

Note that the new words may not necessarily be different.

Input Format:
The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$)  — the number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated strings, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both of length $$$3$$$. The strings only contain lowercase Latin letters.

Output Format:
For each test case, after the swap, output $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, separated by a space.

Note:
None
