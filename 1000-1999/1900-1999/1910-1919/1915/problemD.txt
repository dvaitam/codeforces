Description:
Lura was bored and decided to make a simple language using the five letters $$$\texttt{a}$$$, $$$\texttt{b}$$$, $$$\texttt{c}$$$, $$$\texttt{d}$$$, $$$\texttt{e}$$$. There are two types of letters:

- vowels — the letters $$$\texttt{a}$$$ and $$$\texttt{e}$$$. They are represented by $$$\textsf{V}$$$.
- consonants — the letters $$$\texttt{b}$$$, $$$\texttt{c}$$$, and $$$\texttt{d}$$$. They are represented by $$$\textsf{C}$$$.

A word in the language is a sequence of syllables. Lura has written a word in the language, but she doesn't know how to split it into syllables. Help her break the word into syllables.

For example, given the word $$$\texttt{bacedbab}$$$, it would be split into syllables as $$$\texttt{ba.ced.bab}$$$ (the dot $$$\texttt{.}$$$ represents a syllable boundary).

Input Format:
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the word.

The second line of each test case contains a string consisting of $$$n$$$ lowercase Latin characters  — the word.

All words given are valid words in the language; that is, they only use the letters $$$\texttt{a}$$$, $$$\texttt{b}$$$, $$$\texttt{c}$$$, $$$\texttt{d}$$$, $$$\texttt{e}$$$, and each word is made up of several syllables.

The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

Output Format:
For test case, output a string denoting the word split into syllables by inserting a dot $$$\texttt{.}$$$ between every pair of adjacent syllables.

If there are multiple possible splittings, output any of them. The input is given in such a way that at least one possible splitting exists.

Note:
None
