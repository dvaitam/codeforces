Description:
You are given three digits $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$. Two of them are equal, but the third one is different from the other two.

Find the value that occurs exactly once.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 270$$$) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$ ($$$0 \leq a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c \leq 9$$$). Two of the digits are equal, but the third one is different from the other two.

Output Format:
For each test case, output the value that occurs exactly once.
