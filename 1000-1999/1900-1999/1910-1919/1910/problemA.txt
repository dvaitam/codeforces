Description:
On the official website of Berland, each account has two parameters: username and ID.

Username is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or digits, which contains at least one letter. For example, user0, 1fox1, zzzz are correct usernames, but 1337 and User22 are not.

The ID of the account for a given username is generated as follows: a positive integer without leading zeroes is appended to the end of the username. For example, the ID user0125 can be generated by the following usernames: user012, user01, user0; but neither by user nor us.

You are given a string $$$s$$$ — a valid ID. Your task is to determine any valid username that can generate the given ID. If there are several correct usernames, you can print any of them.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ ($$$2 \le |s| \le 50$$$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or digits.

Additional constraint on input: there is at least one valid username that can generate the given ID.

Output Format:
For each test case on a separate line, print a string — any valid username that can generate the given ID. If there are multiple correct usernames, you can print any of them.

Note:
None
