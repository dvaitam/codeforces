Description:
You are given two permutations $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$. A permutation is an array of $$$n$$$ elements from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ where all elements are distinct. For example, an array [$$$2,1,3$$$] is a permutation, but [$$$0,1$$$] and [$$$1,3,1$$$] aren't.

You can (as many times as you want) choose two indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, then swap $$$a_i$$$ with $$$a_j$$$ and $$$b_i$$$ with $$$b_j$$$ simultaneously.

You hate inversions, so you want to minimize the total number of inversions in both permutations.

An inversion in a permutation $$$p$$$ is a pair of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$p_i > p_j$$$. For example, if $$$p=[3,1,4,2,5]$$$ then there are $$$3$$$ inversions in it (the pairs of indices are $$$(1,2)$$$, $$$(1,4)$$$ and $$$(3,4)$$$).

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 20\,000$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2\cdot10^5$$$) — the length of the permutations $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq n$$$) — permutation $$$a$$$. The third line contains $$$b$$$ in a similar format.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\cdot10^5$$$.

Output Format:
For each test case, output two permutations $$$a'$$$ and $$$b'$$$ (in the same format as in the input) — the permutations after all operations. The total number of inversions in $$$a'$$$ and $$$b'$$$ should be the minimum possible among all pairs of permutations that can be obtained using operations from the statement.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Note:
In the first test case, the minimum possible number of inversions is $$$10$$$.

In the second test case, we can sort both permutations at the same time. For this, the following operations can be done:

- Swap the elements in the positions $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$ in both permutations. After the operation, $$$a =$$$ [$$$2,1,3$$$], $$$b =$$$ [$$$2,1,3$$$].
- Swap the elements in the positions $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$. After the operations, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are sorted.

In the third test case, the minimum possible number of inversions is $$$7$$$.
