Description:
You are given $$$n$$$ sticks of lengths $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. Find the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously, such that:

- Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick.
- No stick is used in more than $$$1$$$ polygon.

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 100$$$) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 100$$$) — the stick lengths.

Output Format:
For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks available.

Note:
In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon either.

In the third test case, we can use the $$$4$$$ sticks of length $$$3$$$ to create a square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length $$$2$$$, and a square of side length $$$4$$$.
