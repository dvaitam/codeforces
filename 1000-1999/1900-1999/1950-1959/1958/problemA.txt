Description:
In Berland, coins of worth $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$ burles are commonly used (burles are local currency).

Eva has to pay exactly $$$n$$$ burles in a shop. She has an infinite amount of coins of all three types. However, she doesn't like to pay using coins worth $$$1$$$ burle — she thinks they are the most convenient to use.

Help Eva to calculate the minimum number of coins worth $$$1$$$ burle she has to use, if she has to pay exactly $$$n$$$ burles. Note that she can spend any number of coins worth $$$3$$$ and/or $$$5$$$ burles.

Input Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of one line, containing one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 100$$$).

Output Format:
For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of $$$1$$$-burle coins Eva has to use.

Note:
In the first test case, Eva should use $$$1$$$ coin worth $$$1$$$ burle, and $$$2$$$ coins worth $$$3$$$ burles.

In the second test case, Eva should use $$$1$$$ coin worth $$$3$$$ burles and $$$1$$$ coin worth $$$5$$$ burles.

In the third test case, Eva should use $$$14$$$ coins worth $$$3$$$ burles.

In the fourth test case, Eva should use $$$2$$$ coins worth $$$1$$$ burle.

In the fifth test case, Eva should use $$$2$$$ coins worth $$$3$$$ burles and $$$1$$$ coin worth $$$5$$$ burles.
