Description:
You are given an integer $$$n$$$. Output a $$$2n \times 2n$$$ checkerboard made of $$$2 \times 2$$$ squares alternating '$$$\texttt{#}$$$' and '$$$\texttt{.}$$$', with the top-left cell being '$$$\texttt{#}$$$'.

The picture above shows the answers for $$$n=1,2,3,4$$$.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 20$$$) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 20$$$) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length $$$2n$$$.

Output Format:
For each test case, output $$$2n$$$ lines, each containing $$$2n$$$ characters without spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty lines between test cases.

Note:
None
