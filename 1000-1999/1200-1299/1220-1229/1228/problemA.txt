Description:
You have two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$. Find an integer $$$x$$$ which satisfies the conditions below:

- $$$l \le x \le r$$$.
- All digits of $$$x$$$ are different.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Input Format:
The first line contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le 10^{5}$$$).

Output Format:
If an answer exists, print any of them. Otherwise, print $$$-1$$$.

Note:
In the first example, $$$123$$$ is one of the possible answers. However, $$$121$$$ can't be the answer, because there are multiple $$$1$$$s on different digits.

In the second example, there is no valid answer.
