Description:
You are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$. Calculate the number of pairs of arrays $$$(a, b)$$$ such that:

- the length of both arrays is equal to $$$m$$$;
- each element of each array is an integer between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ (inclusive);
- $$$a_i \le b_i$$$ for any index $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$;
- array $$$a$$$ is sorted in non-descending order;
- array $$$b$$$ is sorted in non-ascending order.

As the result can be very large, you should print it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.

Input Format:
The only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 1000$$$, $$$1 \le m \le 10$$$).

Output Format:
Print one integer â€“ the number of arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ satisfying the conditions described above modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.

Note:
In the first test there are $$$5$$$ suitable arrays:

- $$$a = [1, 1], b = [2, 2]$$$;
- $$$a = [1, 2], b = [2, 2]$$$;
- $$$a = [2, 2], b = [2, 2]$$$;
- $$$a = [1, 1], b = [2, 1]$$$;
- $$$a = [1, 1], b = [1, 1]$$$.
