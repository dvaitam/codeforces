Description:
This is an interactive problem. Remember to flush your output while communicating with the testing program. You may use fflush(stdout) in C++, system.out.flush() in Java, stdout.flush() in Python or flush(output) in Pascal to flush the output. If you use some other programming language, consult its documentation. You may also refer to the guide on interactive problems: https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307.

The jury picked an integer $$$x$$$ not less than $$$0$$$ and not greater than $$$2^{14} - 1$$$. You have to guess this integer.

To do so, you may ask no more than $$$2$$$ queries. Each query should consist of $$$100$$$ integer numbers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_{100}$$$ (each integer should be not less than $$$0$$$ and not greater than $$$2^{14} - 1$$$). In response to your query, the jury will pick one integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le 100$$$) and tell you the value of $$$a_i \oplus x$$$ (the bitwise XOR of $$$a_i$$$ and $$$x$$$). There is an additional constraint on the queries: all $$$200$$$ integers you use in the queries should be distinct.

It is guaranteed that the value of $$$x$$$ is fixed beforehand in each test, but the choice of $$$i$$$ in every query may depend on the integers you send.

Input Format:
None

Output Format:
To give the answer, your program should print one line $$$!$$$ $$$x$$$ with a line break in the end. After that, it should flush the output and terminate gracefully.

Note:
The example of interaction is not correct â€” you should sumbit exactly $$$100$$$ integers in each query. Everything else is correct.

Hacks are forbidden in this problem.
