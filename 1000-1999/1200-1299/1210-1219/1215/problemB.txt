Description:
You are given a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ consisting of $$$n$$$ non-zero integers (i.e. $$$a_i \ne 0$$$).

You have to calculate two following values:

1. the number of pairs of indices $$$(l, r)$$$ $$$(l \le r)$$$ such that $$$a_l \cdot a_{l + 1} \dots a_{r - 1} \cdot a_r$$$ is negative;
2. the number of pairs of indices $$$(l, r)$$$ $$$(l \le r)$$$ such that $$$a_l \cdot a_{l + 1} \dots a_{r - 1} \cdot a_r$$$ is positive;

Input Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{5})$$$ — the number of elements in the sequence.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ $$$(-10^{9} \le a_i \le 10^{9}; a_i \neq 0)$$$ — the elements of the sequence.

Output Format:
Print two integers — the number of subsegments with negative product and the number of subsegments with positive product, respectively.

Note:
None
