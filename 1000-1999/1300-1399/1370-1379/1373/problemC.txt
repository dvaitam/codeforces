Description:
You are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters + and -. You perform some process with this string. This process can be described by the following pseudocode:

Note that the $$$inf$$$ denotes infinity, and the characters of the string are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$|s|$$$.

You have to calculate the value of the $$$res$$$ after the process ends.

Input Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.

The only lines of each test case contains string $$$s$$$ ($$$1 \le |s| \le 10^6$$$) consisting only of characters + and -.

It's guaranteed that sum of $$$|s|$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^6$$$.

Output Format:
For each test case print one integer — the value of the $$$res$$$ after the process ends.

Note:
None
