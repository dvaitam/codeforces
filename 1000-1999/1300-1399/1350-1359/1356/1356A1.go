package main

// This stub outlines a classical approach to distinguish between the
// identity gate and the X gate using a single invocation of the
// provided quantum operation. Go doesn't support quantum operations,
// so the exact circuit is described in comments only.
//
// Algorithm (pseudocode):
//  1. Prepare a qubit in the |1> state.
//  2. Apply the provided operation once to this qubit.
//  3. Measure the qubit in the computational (Z) basis.
//  4. If the measurement result is 1, the operation was the identity;
//     output 0. If the result is 0, the operation was X; output 1.
//
// The real implementation would use quantum gates and measurement
// instructions. Here we only provide a placeholder so the file
// compiles.
func main() {
	// No classical I/O is performed. In a real quantum environment,
	// the above procedure would return 0 for identity and 1 for X.
