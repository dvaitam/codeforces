package main

// 1357C1: Prepare a superposition of all N-qubit basis states that contain
// at least one zero. The original problem restricts operations to Pauli and
// Hadamard gates (and their controlled versions) with optional measurements.
// Implementing such a quantum circuit is outside the scope of this Go
// repository, so this file only provides a compilable stub.
//
// In a quantum language one would:
//   1. Start from |0...0⟩.
//   2. Apply H to every qubit to create uniform superposition over all 2^N states.
//   3. Use a multi-controlled operation to exclude the |11..1⟩ state
//      (for example by phase-kickback and measurement-based uncomputation).
//   4. The resulting state is uniform over all states containing at least one 0.

func main() {
    // No classical I/O. Quantum circuit construction would go here.
