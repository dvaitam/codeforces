package main

// 1357A3: Distinguish between H and X gate using at most two applications of the unknown operation.
// The task provides a single-qubit unitary U which is either the Hadamard (H) gate
// or the Pauli-X (X) gate. U also has Adjoint and Controlled variants defined.
// We need to return 0 if U is H and 1 if U is X. Go does not support quantum
// operations natively, so below we outline the intended quantum procedure.
//
// Pseudocode:
//
//	// Allocate two qubits q0 and q1 initialized to |0>.
//	// Apply Controlled-U with q0 as control and q1 as target.
//	// Apply U on q0.
//	// Measure both qubits in the computational basis.
//	// If the result is |1,1> return 1 (U was X), otherwise return 0 (U was H).
//
// The real quantum implementation would use U and Controlled-U once each,
// complying with the limit of two calls to the provided operation.
func main() {
	// No classical I/O. Quantum circuit construction would go here if supported.
