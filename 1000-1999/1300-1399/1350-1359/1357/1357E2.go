package main

// 1357E2: Fractional Quantum Fourier Transform.
//
// The original problem asks to implement an operation equivalent to
// QFT^(1/P) on a LittleEndian qubit register. After applying this
// operation P times, the effect should match a full QFT up to global
// phase. Such functionality requires quantum gates and phase rotations,
// which are not available in pure Go.
//
// This file provides a stub implementation. In a real quantum language
// (e.g. Q#), one would decompose the QFT into rotations and controlled
// operations and then take their P-th roots. The resulting circuit would
// implement the desired unitary transformation.

func main() {
	// No classical I/O. Quantum circuit construction would go here.
}
