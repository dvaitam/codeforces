package main

// This solution corresponds to problem B2: implementing a quantum oracle on N
// qubits that marks whether the little-endian integer represented by the input
// state is divisible by 3. The real solution would describe a sequence of
// controlled-X operations acting on the input qubits and an output qubit.
// Go does not provide native quantum computation capabilities, and the problem
// statement specifies no classical input or output. Therefore, we provide an
// empty main function so that the source file compiles while conveying the
// intent of the problem.

func main() {
	// No runtime behavior; quantum oracle not implemented in this stub.
}
