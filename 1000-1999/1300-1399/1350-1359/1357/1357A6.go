// This program is a stub solution for problem A6.

// unitary (I, X, Y, or Z) was implemented by a given operation,
// using exactly one invocation of the operation (and its adjoint/
// controlled variants). Implementing quantum operations is outside
// the scope of this Go repository, so here we provide a placeholder
// that would be replaced by an actual quantum routine in the proper
// environment.
func main() {
   // In a real solution, quantum state preparation and measurements
   // would be used to decide among the four possibilities.
   // As a placeholder, we output 0.
