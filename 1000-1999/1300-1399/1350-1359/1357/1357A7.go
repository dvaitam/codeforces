// single-qubit operation is Y, -Y, XZ or -XZ using at most
// three invocations of the operation (along with its adjoint
// or controlled variants). Implementing quantum operations is
// outside the scope of this Go repository, so here we merely
// provide the placeholder that would be replaced by an actual
// quantum routine in the proper environment.

	// possibilities. As a placeholder, we output 0.
