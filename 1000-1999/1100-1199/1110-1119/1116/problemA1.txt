Description:
You are given two qubits in state $$$|00 \rangle$$$. Your task is to create the following state on them:

$$$$$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \big( |00 \rangle + |01 \rangle + |10 \rangle)$$$$$$

You have to implement an operation which takes an array of 2 qubits as an input and has no output. The "output" of your solution is the state in which it left the input qubits.

Your code should have the following signature:

Input Format:
None

Output Format:
None

Note:
None
