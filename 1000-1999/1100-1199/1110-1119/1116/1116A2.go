package main

// This solution corresponds to problem A2: quantum operation that generates
// an equal superposition of four given basis states |ψ₀>, |ψ₁>, |ψ₂>, and |ψ₃>
// on N qubits. There is no I/O for this problem; in Q# one would implement an
// operation with signature:
// operation GenerateSuperposition(bits : Bool[][], qubits : Qubit[]) : Unit is Adj + Ctl
// Here in Go we provide a stub main to satisfy compilation requirements.
func main() {
   // No runtime behavior required.
}
