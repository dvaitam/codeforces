package main

// This solution corresponds to problem C3: quantum oracle checking if
// the number of 1 bits in the input vector is divisible by 3.
// There is no I/O for this problem; in Q# one would implement an
// operation with signature:
// operation DivisibleByThreeOracle(x : Qubit[], y : Qubit) : Unit is Adj + Ctl
// Here in Go we provide a stub main to satisfy compilation requirements.
func main() {
   // No runtime behavior required.
