    // by the 3-dimensional quantum Fourier transform, the measurement
    // outcome directly corresponds to an index k = 1 or 2, mapping to
    // result = k - 1. For an unknown input state, the harness will
    // supply one of the two states; here we implement the returned value
    // directly by computing the overlap.

    // will replace this stub with the appropriate logic. For now,
    // we output 0 as a placeholder.
