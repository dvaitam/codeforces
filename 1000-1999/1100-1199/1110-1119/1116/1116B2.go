// |A> = (|0> + |1>)/√2, |B> = (|0> + ω|1>)/√2, |C> = (|0> + ω²|1>)/√2 where ω = e^{2iπ/3}.
// It should return 0 if it is certain the state was not |A>, 1 if not |B>, or 2 if not |C>.
// Such a measurement can exclude one state with optimal probability 2/3 via an appropriate POVM.
// As Go cannot perform quantum measurements directly, this stub outputs 0 as a placeholder.
