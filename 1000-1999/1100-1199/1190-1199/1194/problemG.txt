Description:
Let's call a fraction $$$\frac{x}{y}$$$ good if there exists at least one another fraction $$$\frac{x'}{y'}$$$ such that $$$\frac{x}{y} = \frac{x'}{y'}$$$, $$$1 \le x', y' \le 9$$$, the digit denoting $$$x'$$$ is contained in the decimal representation of $$$x$$$, and the digit denoting $$$y'$$$ is contained in the decimal representation of $$$y$$$. For example, $$$\frac{26}{13}$$$ is a good fraction, because $$$\frac{26}{13} = \frac{2}{1}$$$.

You are given an integer number $$$n$$$. Please calculate the number of good fractions $$$\frac{x}{y}$$$ such that $$$1 \le x \le n$$$ and $$$1 \le y \le n$$$. The answer may be really large, so print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.

Input Format:
The only line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n < 10^{100}$$$).

Output Format:
Print the number of good fractions $$$\frac{x}{y}$$$ such that $$$1 \le x \le n$$$ and $$$1 \le y \le n$$$. The answer may be really large, so print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.
