Description:
You are given $$$q$$$ queries in the following form:

Given three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$ and $$$d_i$$$, find minimum positive integer $$$x_i$$$ such that it is divisible by $$$d_i$$$ and it does not belong to the segment $$$[l_i, r_i]$$$.

Can you answer all the queries?

Recall that a number $$$x$$$ belongs to segment $$$[l, r]$$$ if $$$l \le x \le r$$$.

Input Format:
The first line contains one integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le q \le 500$$$) â€” the number of queries.

Then $$$q$$$ lines follow, each containing a query given in the format $$$l_i$$$ $$$r_i$$$ $$$d_i$$$ ($$$1 \le l_i \le r_i \le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \le d_i \le 10^9$$$). $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$ and $$$d_i$$$ are integers.

Output Format:
For each query print one integer: the answer to this query.

Note:
None
