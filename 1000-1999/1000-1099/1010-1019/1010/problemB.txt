Description:
This is an interactive problem.

Natasha is going to fly to Mars. Finally, Natasha sat in the rocket. She flies, flies... but gets bored. She wishes to arrive to Mars already! So she decides to find something to occupy herself. She couldn't think of anything better to do than to calculate the distance to the red planet.

Let's define $$$x$$$ as the distance to Mars. Unfortunately, Natasha does not know $$$x$$$. But it is known that $$$1 \le x \le m$$$, where Natasha knows the number $$$m$$$. Besides, $$$x$$$ and $$$m$$$ are positive integers.

Natasha can ask the rocket questions. Every question is an integer $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \le y \le m$$$). The correct answer to the question is $$$-1$$$, if $$$x<y$$$, $$$0$$$, if $$$x=y$$$, and $$$1$$$, if $$$x>y$$$. But the rocket is broken — it does not always answer correctly. Precisely: let the correct answer to the current question be equal to $$$t$$$, then, if the rocket answers this question correctly, then it will answer $$$t$$$, otherwise it will answer $$$-t$$$.

In addition, the rocket has a sequence $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$. Each element of the sequence is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. The rocket processes this sequence in the cyclic order, that is $$$1$$$-st element, $$$2$$$-nd, $$$3$$$-rd, $$$\ldots$$$, $$$(n-1)$$$-th, $$$n$$$-th, $$$1$$$-st, $$$2$$$-nd, $$$3$$$-rd, $$$\ldots$$$, $$$(n-1)$$$-th, $$$n$$$-th, $$$\ldots$$$. If the current element is $$$1$$$, the rocket answers correctly, if $$$0$$$ — lies. Natasha doesn't know the sequence $$$p$$$, but she knows its length — $$$n$$$.

You can ask the rocket no more than $$$60$$$ questions.

Help Natasha find the distance to Mars. Assume, that the distance to Mars does not change while Natasha is asking questions.

Your solution will not be accepted, if it does not receive an answer $$$0$$$ from the rocket (even if the distance to Mars is uniquely determined by the already received rocket's answers).

Input Format:
The first line contains two integers $$$m$$$ and $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le m \le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \le n \le 30$$$) — the maximum distance to Mars and the number of elements in the sequence $$$p$$$.

Output Format:
None

Note:
In the example, hacking would look like this:

5 2 3

1 0

This means that the current distance to Mars is equal to $$$3$$$, Natasha knows that it does not exceed $$$5$$$, and the rocket answers in order: correctly, incorrectly, correctly, incorrectly ...

Really:

on the first query ($$$1$$$) the correct answer is $$$1$$$, the rocket answered correctly: $$$1$$$;

on the second query ($$$2$$$) the correct answer is $$$1$$$, the rocket answered incorrectly: $$$-1$$$;

on the third query ($$$4$$$) the correct answer is $$$-1$$$, the rocket answered correctly: $$$-1$$$;

on the fourth query ($$$5$$$) the correct answer is $$$-1$$$, the rocket answered incorrectly: $$$1$$$;

on the fifth query ($$$3$$$) the correct and incorrect answer is $$$0$$$.
