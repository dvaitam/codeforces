Description:
Let's call some positive integer classy if its decimal representation contains no more than $$$3$$$ non-zero digits. For example, numbers $$$4$$$, $$$200000$$$, $$$10203$$$ are classy and numbers $$$4231$$$, $$$102306$$$, $$$7277420000$$$ are not.

You are given a segment $$$[L; R]$$$. Count the number of classy integers $$$x$$$ such that $$$L \le x \le R$$$.

Each testcase contains several segments, for each of them you are required to solve the problem separately.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \le T \le 10^4$$$) — the number of segments in a testcase.

Each of the next $$$T$$$ lines contains two integers $$$L_i$$$ and $$$R_i$$$ ($$$1 \le L_i \le R_i \le 10^{18}$$$).

Output Format:
Print $$$T$$$ lines — the $$$i$$$-th line should contain the number of classy integers on a segment $$$[L_i; R_i]$$$.

Note:
None
