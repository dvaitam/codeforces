Description:
There are $$$n$$$ parrots standing in a circle. Each parrot has a certain level of respect among other parrots, namely $$$r_i$$$. When a parrot with respect level $$$x$$$ starts chattering, $$$x$$$ neighbours to the right and to the left of it start repeating the same words in 1 second. Their neighbours then start repeating as well, and so on, until all the birds begin to chatter.

You are given the respect levels of all parrots. For each parrot answer a question: if this certain parrot starts chattering, how many seconds will pass until all other birds will start repeating it?

Input Format:
In the first line of input there is a single integer $$$n$$$, the number of parrots ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$$$).

In the next line of input there are $$$n$$$ integers $$$r_1$$$, ..., $$$r_n$$$, the respect levels of parrots in order they stand in the circle ($$$1 \leq r_i \leq n$$$).

Output Format:
Print $$$n$$$ integers. $$$i$$$-th of them should equal the number of seconds that is needed for all parrots to start chattering if the $$$i$$$-th parrot is the first to start.

Note:
None
