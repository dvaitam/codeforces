Description:
You are given an array $$$a$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$ positive integers.

Let's call a concatenation of numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ the number that is obtained by writing down numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ one right after another without changing the order. For example, a concatenation of numbers $$$12$$$ and $$$3456$$$ is a number $$$123456$$$.

Count the number of ordered pairs of positions $$$(i, j)$$$ ($$$i \neq j$$$) in array $$$a$$$ such that the concatenation of $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ is divisible by $$$k$$$.

Input Format:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$2 \le k \le 10^9$$$).

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$).

Output Format:
Print a single integer â€” the number of ordered pairs of positions $$$(i, j)$$$ ($$$i \neq j$$$) in array $$$a$$$ such that the concatenation of $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ is divisible by $$$k$$$.

Note:
In the first example pairs $$$(1, 2)$$$, $$$(1, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3)$$$, $$$(3, 1)$$$, $$$(3, 4)$$$, $$$(4, 2)$$$, $$$(4, 3)$$$ suffice. They produce numbers $$$451$$$, $$$4510$$$, $$$110$$$, $$$1045$$$, $$$1012$$$, $$$121$$$, $$$1210$$$, respectively, each of them is divisible by $$$11$$$.

In the second example all $$$n(n - 1)$$$ pairs suffice.

In the third example no pair is sufficient.
