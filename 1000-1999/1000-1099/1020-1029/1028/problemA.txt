Description:
Consider a table of size $$$n \times m$$$, initially fully white. Rows are numbered $$$1$$$ through $$$n$$$ from top to bottom, columns $$$1$$$ through $$$m$$$ from left to right. Some square inside the table with odd side length was painted black. Find the center of this square.

Input Format:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 115$$$) — the number of rows and the number of columns in the table.

The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains a string of $$$m$$$ characters $$$s_{i1} s_{i2} \ldots s_{im}$$$ ($$$s_{ij}$$$ is 'W' for white cells and 'B' for black cells), describing the $$$i$$$-th row of the table.

Output Format:
Output two integers $$$r$$$ and $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \le r \le n$$$, $$$1 \le c \le m$$$) separated by a space — the row and column numbers of the center of the black square.

Note:
None
