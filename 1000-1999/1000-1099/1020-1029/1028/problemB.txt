Description:
Let $$$s(x)$$$ be sum of digits in decimal representation of positive integer $$$x$$$. Given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, find some positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ such that

- $$$s(a) \ge n$$$,
- $$$s(b) \ge n$$$,
- $$$s(a + b) \le m$$$.

Input Format:
The only line of input contain two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le n, m \le 1129$$$).

Output Format:
Print two lines, one for decimal representation of $$$a$$$ and one for decimal representation of $$$b$$$. Both numbers must not contain leading zeros and must have length no more than $$$2230$$$.

Note:
In the first sample, we have $$$n = 6$$$ and $$$m = 5$$$. One valid solution is $$$a = 6$$$, $$$b = 7$$$. Indeed, we have $$$s(a) = 6 \ge n$$$ and $$$s(b) = 7 \ge n$$$, and also $$$s(a + b) = s(13) = 4 \le m$$$.
