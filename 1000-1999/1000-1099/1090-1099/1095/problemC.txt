Description:
A positive integer $$$x$$$ is called a power of two if it can be represented as $$$x = 2^y$$$, where $$$y$$$ is a non-negative integer. So, the powers of two are $$$1, 2, 4, 8, 16, \dots$$$.

You are given two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. Your task is to represent $$$n$$$ as the sum of exactly $$$k$$$ powers of two.

Input Format:
The only line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^9$$$, $$$1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).

Output Format:
If it is impossible to represent $$$n$$$ as the sum of $$$k$$$ powers of two, print NO.

Otherwise, print YES, and then print $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_k$$$ such that each of $$$b_i$$$ is a power of two, and $$$\sum \limits_{i = 1}^{k} b_i = n$$$. If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note:
None
