Description:
You are given a range of positive integers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$.

Find such a pair of integers $$$(x, y)$$$ that $$$l \le x, y \le r$$$, $$$x \ne y$$$ and $$$x$$$ divides $$$y$$$.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

You are also asked to answer $$$T$$$ independent queries.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 \le T \le 1000$$$) — the number of queries.

Each of the next $$$T$$$ lines contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \le l \le r \le 998244353$$$) — inclusive borders of the range.

It is guaranteed that testset only includes queries, which have at least one suitable pair.

Output Format:
Print $$$T$$$ lines, each line should contain the answer — two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ such that $$$l \le x, y \le r$$$, $$$x \ne y$$$ and $$$x$$$ divides $$$y$$$. The answer in the $$$i$$$-th line should correspond to the $$$i$$$-th query from the input.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Note:
None
