Description:
You are given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of positive integers, with length $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ respectively.

Let $$$c$$$ be an $$$n \times m$$$ matrix, where $$$c_{i,j} = a_i \cdot b_j$$$.

You need to find a subrectangle of the matrix $$$c$$$ such that the sum of its elements is at most $$$x$$$, and its area (the total number of elements) is the largest possible.

Formally, you need to find the largest number $$$s$$$ such that it is possible to choose integers $$$x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2$$$ subject to $$$1 \leq x_1 \leq x_2 \leq n$$$, $$$1 \leq y_1 \leq y_2 \leq m$$$, $$$(x_2 - x_1 + 1) \times (y_2 - y_1 + 1) = s$$$, and $$$$$$\sum_{i=x_1}^{x_2}{\sum_{j=y_1}^{y_2}{c_{i,j}}} \leq x.$$$$$$

Input Format:
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \leq n, m \leq 2000$$$).

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_i \leq 2000$$$).

The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \leq b_i \leq 2000$$$).

The fourth line contains a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^{9}$$$).

Output Format:
If it is possible to choose four integers $$$x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2$$$ such that $$$1 \leq x_1 \leq x_2 \leq n$$$, $$$1 \leq y_1 \leq y_2 \leq m$$$, and $$$\sum_{i=x_1}^{x_2}{\sum_{j=y_1}^{y_2}{c_{i,j}}} \leq x$$$, output the largest value of $$$(x_2 - x_1 + 1) \times (y_2 - y_1 + 1)$$$ among all such quadruplets, otherwise output $$$0$$$.
