Description:
You are given N = 2k qubits (0 ≤ k ≤ 4) in zero state $${\left|0\dots0\right\rangle}$$. Your task is to create a generalized W state on them. Generalized W state is an equal superposition of all basis states on N qubits that have Hamming weight equal to 1:

$${ \left| W _ { N } \right\rangle } = { \frac { 1 } { \sqrt { N } } } ( { \left| 1 0 0... 0 \right\rangle } + { \left| 0 1 0... 0 \right\rangle } + \ldots + { \left| 0 0... 0 1 \right\rangle } )$$

For example, for N = 1, $$| W_{1} \rangle = | 1 \rangle$$.

You have to implement an operation which takes an array of N qubits as an input and has no output. The "output" of the operation is the state in which it leaves the qubits.

Your code should have the following signature:

Input Format:
None

Output Format:
None

Note:
None
