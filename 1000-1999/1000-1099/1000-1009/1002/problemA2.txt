Description:
You are given N qubits (1 ≤ N ≤ 8) in zero state $${\left|0\dots0\right\rangle}$$. You are also given a bitstring bits which describes a non-zero basis state on N qubits $${\left|{\psi}\right\rangle}$$.

Your task is to generate a state which is an equal superposition of $${\left|0\dots0\right\rangle}$$ and the given basis state:

$${ \left| S \right\rangle } = { \frac { 1 } { \sqrt { 2 } } } ( { \left| 0... 0 \right\rangle } + { \left| \psi \right\rangle } )$$

You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs:

- an array of qubits qs,
- an arrays of boolean values bits representing the basis state $${\left|{\psi}\right\rangle}$$. This array will have the same length as the array of qubits. The first element of this array bits[0] will be true.

The operation doesn't have an output; its "output" is the state in which it leaves the qubits.

An array of boolean values represents a basis state as follows: the i-th element of the array is true if the i-th qubit is in state $$\left|1\right\rangle$$, and false if it is in state $$| 0 \rangle$$. For example, array [true; false] describes 2-qubit state $$|\psi\rangle = |10\rangle$$, and in this case the resulting state should be $${ \frac { 1 } { \sqrt { 2 } } } ( | 0 0 \rangle + | 1 0 \rangle ) = | + \rangle \otimes | 0 \rangle$$.

Your code should have the following signature:
