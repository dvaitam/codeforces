Description:
You are given a qubit in state $$| 0 \rangle$$ and an integer sign.

Your task is to convert the given qubit to state $${ \left| + \right\rangle } = { \frac { 1 } { \sqrt { 2 } } } ( { \left| 0 \right\rangle } + { \left| 1 \right\rangle } )$$ if sign = 1 or $${ \left| - \right\rangle } = { \frac { 1 } { \sqrt { 2 } } } ( { \left| 0 \right\rangle } - { \left| 1 \right\rangle } )$$ if sign =  - 1.

Input Format:
You have to implement an operation which takes a qubit and an integer as an input and has no output. The "output" of your solution is the state in which it left the input qubit.

Your code should have the following signature:

Output Format:
None

Note:
None
